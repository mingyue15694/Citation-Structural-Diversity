        "Abstract": "A 78-year-old woman with long-standing obstipation presented herself to the hospital with diarrhoea and progressive abdominal cramping since 2 days. Acute abdomen developed and an emergency exploratory laparotomy was indicated, which showed no signs of bowel ischaemia. After admission to the internal ward, stool Clostridium difficile PCR was tested positive. Hence the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis became apparent. Abdominal imaging demonstrated multiple gas foci in the wall of the bladder and extensive pseudomembranous colitis. The patient was initially treated with oral vancomycin and secondarily with metronidazole for recurrent C. difficile infection. Resolution of diarrhoea and abdominal cramping was noted on 6-week follow-up visit.",

        "Abstract": "Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening condition often manifesting as a multisystem disease; its heterogeneous features present a diagnostic challenge. We report two cases of IE masquerading as rare extracardiac complications: a splenectomised patient with a periarticular ankle abscess and acute encephalopathy; and a young man with a cutaneous vasculitis following a spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. In both cases, the diagnosis was suspected following detection of afebrile bacteraemia and confirmed with echocardiography. Risk factors included a pneumococcal bacteraemia in the asplenic patient and a previously undiagnosed bicuspid aortic valve in the second patient. Both patients recovered well with appropriate antibiotic therapy followed by valve surgery. IE is an important diagnosis to consider in patients with systemic symptoms or organ specific, otherwise unexplained relevant pathology especially in the presence of a cardiac murmur or risk factors for IE including structural heart disease, prosthetic valves or intravascular devices, and in immunosuppressed patients.

The patient was admitted due to suicidal behaviours and developed an agitated catatonic state while in the inpatient psychiatry unit. An extensive diagnostic study allowed for the diagnosis of coeliac disease and while her state was unresponsive to antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics and electroconvulsive therapy, the patient improved significantly when a gluten-free diet was started. While it is well known that, occasionally, gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease can present as brain gluten sensitivity, such cases are typically characterised by motor and/or cognitive symptoms and by white matter abnormalities.

Immediately following the procedure, he became suddenly unresponsive with vertical gaze palsy, anisocoria and bilateral upgoing plantar responses. He made a rapid recovery to his premorbid state 25 min later with no residual focal neurological signs. He then had multiple unresponsive episodes, interspaced with complete resolution of symptoms and neurological signs. MRI of the brain identified bilateral medial thalamic infarcts and midbrain infarcts, consistent with an artery of Percheron territory infarction. By the time the diagnosis was reached, the thrombolysis window had elapsed. The unresponsive episodes diminished with time and the patient was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. At 6-month review after the episode, the patient has a degree of progressive cognitive impairment.",

Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 infection was confirmed by serology specimens taken 10 days apart. Iron overload was detected, and homozygous C282Y gene mutation confirmed HH. Liver biopsy revealed grade IV siderosis with micronodular cirrhosis. Haemochromatosis is a common, inherited disorder leading to iron overload that can produce end-organ damage from excess iron deposition. Haemochromatosis diagnosis allowed aggressive medical management with phlebotomy achieving normalisation of iron stores. Screening for complications of cirrhosis was started that included hepatoma surveillance. Iron overload states are known to increase patient susceptibility to infections caused by lower virulence bacteria lacking sophisticated iron metabolism pathways, for example, Yersinia enterocolitica Although these serious disseminated infections are rare, they may serve as markers for occult iron overload and should prompt haemochromatosis screening.",

        "Abstract": "Sleep problems in toddlers occur in ∼40% of children and increase the likelihood of postnatal depression. Most sleep training in toddlers requires contact with a trained professional, and requires a parent to ignore their child's cries, causing distress to many children and parents, increasing attrition and leaving families untreated and at risk. This case study reports success in significantly ameliorating sleep reluctance and bedtime fears in a sleep disturbed toddler with a history of trauma. It uses a novel use of bedtime behaviour management with some positive reinforcement techniques, called the Boss of My Sleep book: a non-cry, online (thus readily and cheaply available without a trained professional) sleep intervention. The system was successful immediately and was sustained after 6 months. The Boss of My Sleep book shows promise as a sleep intervention in toddlers, particularly for those parents who do not want to use cry intensive methods.",

Plain X-rays of the C-spine showed no osseous lesion. Owing to persisting pain and limited motion in the neck, MRI of the C-spine was obtained which revealed intact ligaments and cervical spinal cord, as well as soft tissue swelling in front of the anterior arch of the atlas. Subsequent CT of the C-spine confirmed a complete, undisplaced fracture of the anterior arch of the atlas (Gehweiler type I fracture). A Minerva cast was applied for 2 months, followed by a soft cervical collar. Persistent neck pain and limited range of motion of the neck after a fall may be indicative of atlas fracture that should be ruled out by CT.",

We report a case of six consecutive pregnancies in one woman, where CHI was detected following an intrauterine death in the fifth pregnancy, after being missed in four earlier losses. The successful sixth pregnancy was treated with a combination of immunosuppressive and antithrombotic agents. While low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and aspirin had been shown to improve pregnancy outcome in recurrent pregnancy loss, there was limited evidence of improved outcome in CHI. It has been suggested that CHI may result from a maternal immunological process and there have been a few reports of the use of corticosteroids because of this possibility, though without convincing evidence of efficacy. We too tried a corticosteroid, in combination with LMWH and aspirin. Comparative histopathological analysis of the placentae supported post-treatment effectiveness of our intervention strategy.",

It is more commonly seen as a congenital phenomenon in the paediatric population, and has not previously been described in the literature in adults. We present the case of a man aged 52 years who developed a complex anoscrotal fistula after a radical inguinal orchidectomy for an intratesticular seminoma. A postsurgical wound-site infection developed into a chronically discharging wound refractory to antibiotic treatment prompting further investigation. By way of MRI, a 10 cm long trans-sphincteric anoscrotal fistula was found. The patient was successfully treated by fistuloscopic curettage, internal closure using an Ovesco clip, and negative pressure dressing. We present for the first time a rare anoscrotal fistula in an adult.",

        "Abstract": "Pentalogy of Fallot is a cyanotic congenital heart disease that has guarded prognosis without surgical intervention in infancy. Women with uncorrected defects rarely survive into childbearing age and pregnancy in this group is associated with a high rate of perinatal loss. Physiological cardiovascular changes in pregnancy can lead to maternal haemodynamic instability with subsequent adverse cardiac sequelae with or without fetal decompensation. Optimum management and pregnancy outcomes in mother with uncorrected Pentalogy of Fallot and twin pregnancy have not been described in the literature. We describe a successful case of monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy in an affected woman who has not undergone surgical repair. Her pregnancy progressed without any adverse cardiopulmonary complications. Her caesarean delivery and postpartum recovery were favourable, with successful birth of two healthy babies at 35.7 weeks. This case emphasises the importance of a multidisciplinary team, especially of obstetricians with expertise in high-risk pregnancies, adult congenital heart disease cardiologists and anaesthesiologist.",

Squamous cell carcinomas are considered chemosensitive tumours compared to adenocarcinomas or anaplastic thyroid malignancies. A 76-year-old man was found to have T4bN0M0 primary squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid with encasement of the internal carotid artery. The disease was deemed unresectable. Therefore, he was treated with radical radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy. We discuss herein the aetiology, diagnosis and management of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid.

The lateness of this presentation was likely due to the protective α blocking effects of long-term terazosin therapy for his prostatism. α blockers such as terazosin are a well-recognised medical therapy in the perioperative optimisation of phaeochromocytoma because they treat the adrenergic effects of catecholamine release from the tumour such as hypertension. This patient was diagnosed with an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A cardiac angiogram showed no evidence of vessel occlusion. A right adrenal mass of 9×8×9 cm was incidentally found and confirmed as a phaeochromocytoma with raised plasma metanephrines and normetanephrines. Following preoperative optimisation and multidisciplinary team involvement, an open right adrenalectomy was performed successfully some months later.",

Serial ultrasound scans and MRI scans were not diagnostic, but microbiological specimens tested positive for the fungus Scedosporium apiospermum The renal transplant graft-which was failing-was removed, allowing him to cease immunosuppression. He then underwent a resection of the lesion and reconstruction with a split thickness skin graft. Analysis of the specimen revealed fibrosis, granulomatosis and a collection of S. apiospermum He was started on voriconazole which, in conjunction with his surgical resection, appears to have kept the disease at bay.

While the need for acute trauma services is obvious in conflict zones, patients with chronic diseases also require care. This report describes the clinical course of a young teenage girl with a large mid pelvic tumour originating from the left ovary and reaching the umbilicus. She presented with acute abdominal pain and underwent surgery in a healthcare facility within a conflict zone. She was then transferred to a neighbouring country for continuing care. The tumour is malignant. After further surgery, she required chemotherapy and will need ongoing surveillance. She has since returned to her home country. It is doubtful that she will be able to access all the care she needs.

        "Abstract": "A man aged 56 years with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) status postsubtotal colectomy was hospitalised with fevers, dry cough, eye redness and a new bloody, mucoid rectal discharge. 2 months prior to admission, the dermatologist had started him on dapsone for subcorneal pustular dermatosis but did not recognise that he had recently self-discontinued mesalamine enemas, inducing a flare of his UC. After a thorough inpatient evaluation, including flexible sigmoidoscopy, active UC involving the rectal stump was determined to be driving his dermatological and ophthalmological findings. By reinstituting mesalamine enemas, control of his UC was achieved and the extraintestinal manifestations of his inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) resolved. This case illustrates the importance of careful history taking and of early recognition of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD in order to appropriately target treatment and prevent unnecessary morbidity.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Multiple myeloma presenting with bilateral ankle pain (microangiopathy) and complicated by streptococcal meningitis and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.",
        "Abstract": "Multiple myeloma is characterised by the neoplastic proliferation of a single clone of plasma cells producing a monoclonal immunoglobulin. This clone of plasma cells proliferates in the bone marrow, resulting in extensive skeletal destruction with osteolytic lesions, osteopenia and pathological fractures. Additional disease-related complications include hypercalcaemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia and infection. We present the case of a 64-year-old woman presenting with rapid onset, painful distal symmetrical lower limb weakness and an acute kidney injury. Owing to her IgG κ paraprotein (kappa light chain 4620, kappa:lambda ratio 826), she was diagnosed with probable plasma cell myeloma. This diagnosis was confirmed following a trephine biopsy. She required renal replacement therapy, inotropic support and a percutaneous tracheostomy. She became acutely confused with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10/15 and a CT head showed no acute pathology. Further investigation with a lumbar puncture confirmed the diagnosis of streptococcal meningitis. She was treated with intravenous acyclovir, ceftriaxone and fluconazole. Her non-bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and she required treatment with co-trimoxazole. This case report discusses the clinical presentation, diagnostic algorithm and treatment of myeloma. This manuscript offers an important clinical reminder to consider myeloma in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with bone pain and acute kidney injury.",

She initially underwent superficial keratectomy with amniotic membrane graft in 1999. Subsequently, cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation was performed in 2001 which improved her vision to 20/400. Following development of pannus and symblepharon in the left eye, she underwent pannus resection and conjunctival limbal autograft in 2002 and, a month later, optical penetrating keratoplasty (PK) following which her vision improved to 20/125. She was under regular follow-up, underwent exotropia correction and subsequent levator palpebrae superioris resection for ptosis and was maintaining good vision. On her last follow-up 14 years after PK in 2016, her vision in the left eye was 20/40 with lipid keratopathy and her right eye showed no signs of focal limbal stem cell deficiency.",

During labour, fetal movement and fetal heart tones became undetectable, at which time the patient was referred by the midwife to the hospital. The patient was diagnosed with uterine rupture, bladder rupture and fetal demise; she was rushed to emergency surgery. The patient's lack of allopathic prenatal care, attempt of vaginal birth after three previous caesarean sections, coupled with her desire for delivery at home, led to her complicated course.

Monozygotic twins developed UC at ages 49 and 51, and they were separately treated at different medical institutes. They did not know that they had the same disease and were treated with the same drug (5-ASA). During the course of 5-ASA treatment, renal impairment diagnosed as interstitial nephritis occurred in both. Granulocyte/monocyte adsorption was initiated, UC remission was achieved and renal function deterioration subsided in both. Drug or treatment responses may be concordant in monozygotic twins with UC.

He was initially managed in the community with flucoclaxacillin for 1 week, but failed to respond to treatment. Clinical history was suggestive of Fournier's gangrene, but initial examination was not conclusive. Repeated examination over the next hour aided diagnosis and helped to track the progression of the condition. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and prepared for theatre. Since there was a delay in getting the patient to theatre, an ultrasound scan was performed to help ascertain the extent of the disease to aid surgical planning. Following successful debridement and skeletalisation of the testicles and ward recovery, he was transferred for plastic reconstruction.",

A woman aged 46 years, with metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma, was found to have a large mass in the inferior vena cava (IVC) extending into the right atrium. Although this lesion was initially thought to be bland thrombus, imaging with contrast-enhanced CT scan and contrast-enhanced ultrasound supported the diagnosis of tumour thrombus. Despite the large size of the lesion, the patient was asymptomatic. Her lack of symptoms, and poor overall prognosis from her cancer led to the decision to avoid aggressive surgical or radiological interventions. Several months later, the patient passed away. At autopsy, there was no evidence of fatal embolisation from the pre-existing thrombus. Diagnosis of tumour thrombus in the IVC is difficult and management can be challenging due to the significant risks associated with treatment options.",

PAN generally presents with constitutional, cutaneous, neurological, renal and gastrointestinal manifestations. However, PAN initially involving a single organ/system is uncommon. Here, we present a 42-year-old man who was hospitalised because of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain that started 2 months before. Physical examination was remarkable for right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Abdominopelvic CT showed lymphadenopathy but no hepatic, gallbladder, pancreatic, intestinal or renal abnormalities. Abdominal angiography showed multiple small aneurysms located in the jejunal and hepatic arteries characteristic of PAN. He had a prompt and remarkable response to high-dose corticosteroids and oral cyclophosphamide. Our case, together with other reports, suggests that PAN should be considered in patients presenting with right upper abdominal pain.

        "Abstract": "The aim of this case report is to draw attention on possible false human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping in acquired aplastic anaemia prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In acquired aplastic anaemia loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 6p is known to occur in around 12%. We report false HLA genotyping results due to LOH and a coinciding steep rise in neutrophils following filgrastim stimulation in a patient with very severe aplastic anaemia. At diagnosis we obtained heterozygous results on peripheral blood. Failing to reach a partial response at 6 months with immune-suppressive therapy we repeated HLA genotyping, obtaining homozygous results. Repeated testing confirmed loss of HLA genotype heterozygosity. HLA genotyping on cells obtained by a buccal swab confirmed the previous HLA heterozygosity. A second course of filgrastim at the time of homozygous HLA genotyping resulted in a steep rise in neutrophils. Stopping filgrastim resulted in an equally steep drop.",

The described case illustrates management with intraoperative superior mesenteric artery to hepatic artery bypass graft that led to haemorrhagic challenges postoperatively but ultimately a good recovery. Aspects of preoperative diagnosis, preoperative intervention and intraoperative management options are reviewed.

        "Abstract": "A 50-year-old male UK resident with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia presented to the emergency department with a 48-hour history of sudden onset bilateral thigh swelling and pain unrelieved by regular analgesia. 3 days prior to presentation, he performed a vigorous workout in the gym. His medications included ramipril 5 mg once daily and atorvastatin 20 mg at night time. He was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol. He reported no known drug allergies. Physical examination confirmed bilateral swollen thighs, with no overlying skin changes, clinically suggestive of compartment syndrome. His creatine kinase was >50 000 IU with normal renal and liver function tests. Further investigation with MRI-identified prominent swelling of the vastus intermedius and medialis muscles, more marked on the left, with extensive diffuse short tau inversion recovery (STIR) signal hyperintensity and isointensity on T1 sequences, suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. He underwent bilateral fasciotomies of his thighs and aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation with close monitoring of his electrolytes. Intraoperatively his muscle was healthy, with no evidence of haematoma or necrosis. His medication atorvastatin was stopped due to his rhabdomyolysis. 48 hours later, he returned to theatre and review of his fasciotomy wounds was unremarkable. 4 days later, he was discharged uneventfully. His postoperative recovery was complicated by a serous discharge from his left medial thigh wound. Further investigation with an ultrasound confirmed a 4×1×1cm multiloculated collection within the superficial tissue directly underlying the wound. An aspirate was performed and cultures revealed no growth. He remains under review in the department of plastic surgery. This case report discusses the aetiological spectrum, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, investigations, management and complications of rhabdomyolysis.",

        "Abstract": "A 69-year-old man presented to the emergency department with lower respiratory tract infection and febrile neutropaenia. He was recently discharged following a 50-day hospital stay with newly diagnosed microscopic polyangiitis, complicated by pulmonary haemorrhage and severe renal dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapy, plasma exchange and immunosuppression (cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone). High risk of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) led to an escalation in treatment from prophylactic to therapeutic oral co-trimoxazole, alongside broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient suffered from severe and protracted hypoglycaemia, complicated by a tonic-clonic seizure 7 days after escalation to therapeutic co-trimoxazole. Endogenous hyperinsulinaemia was confirmed and was attributed to co-trimoxazole use. Hypoglycaemia resolved 48 hours after discontinuation of co-trimoxazole. PCP testing on bronchoalveolar lavage was negative. Owing to the prescription of heavy immunosuppression in patients with vasculitis and the subsequent risk of PCP warranting co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, we believe that the risk of hypoglycaemia should be highlighted.",

There he carried out daily physical, occupational and speech therapy, with an emphasis on task-oriented treatment. The patient's upper-extremity motor performance was evaluated at admission to the rehabilitation centre and before leaving the hospital by 3 different measurement tools: the upper-extremity motor part of the Fugl-Meyer assessment scale, electromyography in hand-reach and grasp and object manipulation and handwriting tasks. Significant improvement in hand function was observed in proximal as well as in distal skills. Significant improvement in handwriting skills and decreased impairment level of the upper extremity had considerable effects on the quality of life of the patient. The case report emphasises the importance of intensive task-oriented training during the first 3 months after stroke to support the natural recovery of the lesioned area.",

Here, we present the case of a man aged 67 years who only developed apathy after surgery for oesophageal cancer. He showed no response to intervention with donepezil, a 'brain training' video game and psychoeducation for apathy. Subsequently, we implemented a programme designed to facilitate recall of 2 themes (editorial content and television shows during the week) once a week. After 3 months, the scores of 2 apathy scales rated by the patient's wife, psychological test scores and brain perfusion single-photon emission CT data improved compared with those obtained before intervention. These results may be attributable to activated 2-way communication as well as benefits of reminiscence therapy, as seen in patients with dementia. Further studies are needed to develop additional non-pharmacological interventions that activate 2-way communication for apathetic patients in ways appropriate to their interests and comorbidities.",

Owing to the extreme rarity of de Garengeot's hernia, it could represent a diagnostic challenge; however, it should remain in the differential diagnosis, particularly in this patient demographic. A female patient aged 96 years, who presented as an emergency with acute right iliac fossa pain, was found to have de Garengeot's hernia. The diagnosis was made intraoperatively, where she was treated with an appendicectomy and repair of the hernia defect. The incidence of de Garengeot's hernia is 0.5-5% and the incidence of appendicitis within a femoral hernia is extremely rare. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging to the treating surgeon, which requires a high index of suspicion and is usually made intraoperatively. There is no standard treatment; however, simple appendicectomy and hernia repair seems to be an accepted management.",

This tumour was secreting ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a paraneoplastic endocrine phenomenon, which resulted in Cushing syndrome symptomatology. Though most ectopic ACTH-producing lung cancers are either small cell or carcinoid tumours, this was in fact a large cell neuroendocrine cancer (LCNEC).

        "Abstract": "Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) catheter site metastasis in cases of cholangiocarcinoma is reported sporadically. But it is unusual to see left-sided tumour metastasising to the right PTBD catheter site. Metastasis, in general, has a poor prognosis, but recurrence along the catheter tract in the absence of other systemic diseases can be a different scenario altogether. To date, there is no consensus on the management of this form of metastasis. But carefully selected patients can benefit from aggressive surgical resection. We report a case of a young patient with isolated chest wall metastasis 1 year after resection of left-sided hilar cholangiocarcinoma. The metastasis was resected and, on pathological analysis, was confirmed to be due to implantation of malignant cells along the tract of the PTBD catheter placed via a transpleural route.",

Sanger sequencing of DNA extracted from a 2008 skin lesion identified two non-contiguous base substitutions in , which were shown by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to be located in the same allele. Due to its long-standing duration, molecular evolution of disease was possible; however, both Sanger and NGS of a 2000 skin lesion were unsuccessful due to the poor quality of DNA. Finally, droplet digital PCR using a probe specific for this novel mutation detected the complex BRAF mutation in both the 2000 and 2008 lesions, indicating this case to be ECD with a novel underlying BRAF p.Thr599_Val600delinsArgGlu mutation. Although well at present, molecular modelling of the mutant BRAF suggests suboptimal binding of vemurafenib and hence reduced therapeutic effectiveness."

We present the case of a 40-year-old woman transferred to our centre following elective LC for a reported perforated duodenal ulcer. An uncontained leak was found to originate from a 1.5 cm duodenal defect, with no evidence of ulceration. A duodenostomy tube was placed. One month after abdominal closure, the patient continued to have a persistent, large duodenal fistula. A through-the-scope covered oesophageal stent was placed under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. Five weeks later, it was successfully retrieved and no subsequent extravasation of contrast from the duodenum was noted. Unrecognised iatrogenic duodenal injuries sustained during LC can be catastrophic. In cases of massive duodenal defects and high-output biliary fistula uncontrolled after surgical intervention, endoscopic-guided and fluoroscopic-guided placement of a fully covered oesophageal stent may be lifesaving.",

Metastases occur commonly in lymph nodes and bone but have also been known to involve certain visceral organs, particularly the lungs. Involvement of soft tissue by metastases is far less common, particularly in the context of cancer recurrence. We present the case of a male aged 68 years who presented with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 10 years after radical prostatectomy (RP). The PSA increased despite salvage radiotherapy and was ultimately found to be caused by a PSA secreting prostate cancer soft tissue mass in the suprapubic region. Surgical resection of the mass caused a sharp decline in the PSA to negligible levels. This case highlights the need for ongoing surveillance post-RP and the potential for prostate cancer recurrence in the soft tissue that is refractory to routine salvage radiotherapy.",

Whole body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT) showed fluorodeoxyglucose-avid mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy with hepatic, splenic, parotid and lacrimal glandular inflammations. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of subcarinal lymph node showed non-caseating granulomas. Initial serum ACE level was elevated but with normal calcium. Despite the suspicion of sarcoidosis, a trial of antituberculosis therapy was started empirically due to similar presentations of disseminated tuberculosis (TB) in this high endemic area. The patient subsequently deteriorated and was admitted with symptomatic hypercalcaemia. Her subsequent ACE levels were very high, supportive of a diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis. She was given steroid pulse therapy, and 5 months later had fully recovered. This case highlights the challenges faced by physicians in high TB-endemic areas when managing granulomatous diseases as they are concerned about missing TB, the difficulties in diagnosing sarcoidosis and the role of pulse steroid therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a demyelinating disorder of central nervous system which involves central portion of the pons and sometimes extrapontine areas also. It is commonly reported in settings of hyponatraemia or its rapid correction, but in the last few years it has also been reported in patients with diabetes in the absence of electrolyte disturbances or correction of serum osmolality. Here we report a case of a 20-year-old female patient, with a known history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, who presented with acute onset spastic quadriparesis with dysarthria and mild ataxia which evolved over 2 weeks. Her MRI brain showed well-defined, bilateral symmetric hyperintense lesion involving central pons showing area of diffusion restriction which was consistent with CPM. Patient was treated conservatively and improved over a period of few weeks. To diagnose more number of cases, we should not overlook CPM in patients with diabetes.",

Non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant options should be considered in patients with warfarin-induced skin necrosis (WISN) in the setting of protein C. We report a 41-year-old African American male patient with WISN and protein C deficiency who was treated with rivaroxaban followed by dabigatran. After 1 month on rivaroxaban, he began experiencing blood in his stools, unrelenting pain in his lower extremities, found it difficult to obtain medication despite having insurance and as a result did not maintain compliance. He was then assessed at the hospital, symptomatically treated and discharged on dabigatran. After 6 weeks, he reported symptomatic relief and less side effects. This case involved a head-to-head clinical comparison of rivaroxaban and dabigatran as alternatives to warfarin anticoagulation therapy.",

Within 6 days she developed the full clinical picture of Lemierre's syndrome with the extraordinary manifestation of involvement of her right hip. Despite an interdisciplinary coordinated treatment as well as surgical therapy, a full-blown sepsis evolved within a short time period and resulted in almost 2 months of intensive care. While the primary focus could be successfully controlled, a progressive avascular necrosis of the right proximal femur developed on the basis of a chronic osteomyelitis. This finally led to a pathological fracture of the femoral neck. After excluding the possibility of an enduring bacterial infection, the fracture was treated with a total hip replacement.",

After a 60-year-old woman with a history of smoking underwent a routine chest X-ray revealing a right apical mass, further investigations led to the discovery of a large extrapulmonary arteriovenous haemangioma in the superior mediastinum. Additionally, this case became complicated when the hemangioma was found to not only be compressing adjacent major arteries and veins, but also invading into the spinal canal and displacing the spinal cord. With multidisciplinary planning, the arteriovenous haemangioma was embolised and successfully resected. Thus, we present a case of an arteriovenous haemangioma in the superior mediastinum and discuss the importance of the case.",

We present a 52-year-old man with 1-year history of pain, aggravated by walking and playing tennis. On examination, pain was localised to plantar aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Imaging revealed evolving end-stage avascular necrosis of lateral sesamoid with early secondary degenerative changes. Previous exhaustive conservative treatment had been unsuccessful in alleviating his pain. As an alternative to surgery, radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) was proposed. Treatment protocol was 2000 pulses at frequency of 5 Hz, and pressure was varied from 1.2 to 1.8 bar according to patient tolerance. A total of eight sessions were delivered. At completion of treatment, the patient reported minimal discomfort to no pain and was able to return to playing tennis with no recurrence. We propose rESWT to be an effective novel conservative treatment for sesamoid osteonecrosis.",

Emergent surgical repair improves outcomes, which necessitates robust preoperative stabilisation. Here we discuss a patient with cardiogenic shock with an acute severe MR that was deemed very high risk for emergent valve replacement due to haemodynamic instability and respiratory failure. A percutaneous left ventricular assist device Impella 2.5 (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) drastically improved clinical status, and the patient underwent a successful surgical mitral valve replacement soon after placement of the temporary assist device. Our case highlights that percutaneous ventricular assist devices may help to stabilise patients with severe acute ischaemic MR, and it can serve as a bridge to surgery in high risk patients.",

A 23-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 3003, with uterus didelphys, acquired an iatrogenic interuterine septal defect during an otherwise routine primary caesarean delivery for fetal malpresentation. The defect was repaired but noted to have dehisced during her second pregnancy. A repeat caesarean section was performed due to fetal malpresentation after an unsuccessful external cephalic version. The dehisced defect was left unrepaired. During her third pregnancy, the placenta implanted in the right uterus, but the fetus migrated to the left uterus at approximately 28 weeks gestation. The umbilical cord traversed the interuterine septal defect. With the fetus in the vertex presentation at term gestation, the patient underwent a vaginal birth after two previous caesarean deliveries without any major perinatal complications.",

Some significant histopathological features of MEA and neuroendocrine differentiation identified by immunohistochemistry are described. The tumour showed remarkable and rare degenerative histological characteristics. There were a few tumour cells which were covered by degenerated tissue. Consequently, following frozen biopsy, the tumour was misdiagnosed as chronic ear inflammation. No recurrence was seen in this patient after 45 months of follow-up; regular clinical and radiological follow-up is necessary since recurrence is possible. A literature review for MEA is presented and this type of tumour is discussed clinically, microscopically and immunohistochemically.

Multiple biopsies of this unresectable, 18-fluorodeoxyglucose avid mass revealed marked fibrosis without any evidence of malignancy, suggesting idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis as our initial diagnosis. Multiple interventions including a trial of steroids, fluconazole, and azathioprine to target fibrosing mediastinitis were not successful.

Pericardial effusions are often asymptomatic, particularly in the early phase, but patients are at risk of cardiac tamponade as the effusion progresses. We discuss the case of a 40-year-old male ultramarathon runner with RA who presented with mild pleuritic chest pain and exertional dyspnoea after a recent long-haul flight. Despite a relative tachycardia, his observations were otherwise unremarkable. His blood tests revealed a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 86 mg/L and an anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) titre of 360 units/mL. He was initially diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism; however, a large pericardial effusion was found incidentally on CT pulmonary angiogram with over 1500 mL subsequently drained. The patient's symptoms resolved and CRP normalised 2 weeks later. This unique case illustrates that physically fit patients may physiologically compensate for large pericardial effusions and that arthritic symptoms do not correlate with the severity of extra-articular features in RA.",

        "Abstract": "Acute massive gastric dilatation (AMGD) is a rare distinctive condition but associates with high morbidity and mortality. Though usually seen in patients with eating disorders, many aetiologies of AMGD have been described. The distension has been reported to cause gastric necrosis with or without perforation, usually within 1-2 days of an inciting event of AMGD.We report the case of a 58-year-old male who presented with gastric perforation associated with AMGD 11 days after surgical relief of a proximal small bowel obstruction. The AMGD arose from a closed loop obstruction between a tumour at the gastro-oesophageal junction and a small bowel obstruction as a result of volvulus around a jejunal feeding tube.To our knowledge, this is the first case of a closed loop obstruction of this aetiology reported in the literature, and the presentation of this patient's AMGD was notable for the delayed onset of gastric necrosis. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and a partial gastrectomy to excise a portion of his perforated stomach. Surgeons should be aware of the possibility of delayed ischaemic gastric perforation in cases of AMGD.",

Extensive history and work-up excluded medications, renal disease, insulinoma and dumping syndrome as the cause of hypoglycaemia. Dietary modifications or pharmacological trial of drugs did not ameliorate her symptoms with progressive worsening of hypoglycaemia leading to continuous dextrose infusion.

Preformed crowns are part of the armamentarium in paediatric dentistry. In recent years, aesthetic alternatives to preformed metal crowns have been developed, first preveneered crowns and then zirconia crowns. This paper describes the restoration of a primary molar with a zirconia crown (EZ-Pedo, Loomis, California, USA) in an 8-year-old boy. In this clinical case, the protocol for the implementation and maintenance of zirconia crowns is detailed. The patient was followed up for 29 months until the natural exfoliation of his primary molar. The adaptation of the zirconia crown, the gingival health and the wear on the opposing tooth were considered. In this case, the paediatric zirconia crown allowed sustainable functional restoration while restoring a natural appearance of the tooth.",

Microbiology identified  with the histopathology demonstrating bacterial colonies within the graft interface. Postoperatively she developed endophthalmitis, needing vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics. The infection settled with no recurrence, with topical and oral antibiotics continued for 2 months. A sutured toric piggyback intraocular lens was performed 18 months postvitrectomy for graft astigmatism, achieving a best-corrected vision of 6/15.Infectious crystalline keratopathy can occur following Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty, requiring long-term topical therapy and potentially leading to graft failure with the necessity for further keratoplasty."

Furthermore, how to proceed with the management of these patients is challenging, as in the case of our patient, who had recurrent DAH. We present a case of a patient with known rheumatoid arthritis who had recurrence of DAH that spanned over several years, often presenting with life-threatening respiratory failure. While her DAH presentation improved with high-dose glucocorticoids, to resolve her recurrence, we opted to initiate treatment with rituximab, with a short course of azathioprine. After the second round of rituximab, the patient continues to do well without any further DAH-related complications. We also summarise prior cases of such patients to highlight variable treatment options.",

This was followed by a 6-week course of ambulatory intravenous antibiotic therapy. This conservative management strategy avoided the need for a more invasive and high-risk full device extraction, which the patient clearly stated he did not wish to have. Up-to-date consensus management guidelines recommend extraction of the entire implanted system in this situation; however, in this case we demonstrate an alternative conservative management option, which may be suitable for frail elderly and comorbid patients or for patients who decline device extraction."

We present a case of a 36-year-old woman who developed gallstone pancreatitis and subsequently underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. On histopathology, she was found to have HGD at the cystic duct margin. Following evaluation, she underwent excision of the cystic duct remnant with no malignancy being present on final pathology. We present this case to discuss the management of cystic duct dysplasia in the absence of gallbladder malignancy.",

Pyosalpinx often affects sexually active women and rarely is seen in celibate adolescent girls. We report a case of a 12-year-old girl with no prior sexual history who presented to our emergency department with complaints of severe right lower quadrant pain of 1-day duration. Ultrasonography and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed free fluid collections in the pelvis without visualisation of the appendix. A preoperative diagnosis of acute ruptured appendicitis was given and she was taken to the operating room. Peroperative findings included bilaterally distended, pus-filled pyosalpinges. A definitive diagnosis of bilateral pyosalpinx was then made. Two-week antibiotic therapy was successful but the patient returned with recurrent pyosalpinx and a pelvic abscess 9 weeks later."

        "Abstract": "Two unrelated men complaining of primary male infertility presented to Orient Hospital in Damascus city. Physical examination showed moderate hypoandrogenic features. Both men were azoospermic. Hormone profiles revealed an elevation of follicle-stimulating hormone in one patient, but all the other hormones tested were within normal limits for both patients. Further genetic analyses, including karyotype and microdeletions in the AZF region of the Y chromosome, were normal in both patients. Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome was expected in the two patients. Sequencing analysis of the first exon in the androgen receptor (AR) gene have shown c.1783C>T mutation in the two patients with azoospermia. This paper sheds light on the need to screen for mutations in the AR gene, causing male infertility whenever mild hypoandrogenic features are present with unexplained male infertility.",

The patient initially presented to her general practitioner with a progressive swelling on the neck. Further investigations diagnosed a metastatic lung tumour, and palliative chemotherapy was started. After 5 months of treatment, by newly reported amenorrhoea, cautiously before a restaging CT scan of the abdomen, a pregnancy test was performed and was positive. Both the gynaecological examination and the hormonal panel yielded no signs of pregnancy. Immunohistochemically, staining of the tumour was strongly positive for β-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) suggesting that the tumour was responsible for high β-hCG levels.Paraneoplastic β-hCG secretion from adenocarcinomas is rare. In the literature, only a few such cases have been reported. Previous studies suggested that the ability to secrete β-hCG in tumours may correlate to some extent to chemoresistance and thus, to a worse prognosis.",

We describe the cases of two otherwise healthy brothers who presented with the condition 5 years apart. The first brother, who is also the first author of this case report, presented aged 19 with worsening, right-sided, exercise-induced lower leg pain and transient foot pallor. Imaging confirmed PAES and irreversible localised arterial damage. Surgery was performed to release the entrapment and resect the section of diseased artery. The limb was revascularised using an autologous interposition saphenous vein graft. The second brother began experiencing left-sided, exercise-induced lower leg pain aged 24. Again, imaging revealed PAES and irreversible arterial damage. A similar revascularisation procedure was performed. Both siblings fully recovered and are symptom free. Arterial duplex scans have confirmed patent grafts. A correlation in siblings has only been reported in the literature five times previously.",

It is important to control hypercortisolism during pregnancy, either surgically or medically, for a successful maternal and fetal outcome. We report a patient with recurrent CD who was treated with low-dose cabergoline (CAB) for persistent hypercortisolism throughout pregnancy. A 36-year-old woman was diagnosed with CD at the age of 23. She underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery with initial complete remission. However, 4 years after surgery, CD recurred and she underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS). Following GKRS, her cortisol levels remained elevated despite no evidence of visible tumour on pituitary MRI. Medical treatment was commenced with ketoconazole and cyproheptadine. This was changed to CAB as she was keen for pregnancy. She conceived spontaneously and was on CAB throughout pregnancy. She delivered a healthy male neonate, weighing 3195 g at 40 weeks of gestation.",

After her husband's death in 1994, the patient was forced to leave her home by her late husband's family and arrangements were made for her mother to provide care until her inevitable death. The patient suffered from multiple mental health disturbances as a result of discrimination. Socially isolated after years of self-neglect, she prepared to overdose. In 2007, she became open regarding her status after receiving psychosocial support from various sources. She opened her home as an HIV clinic with the help of a local doctor, and subsequently the majority of her psychological symptoms were resolved. This case illustrates the negative impact that stigma and discrimination can have on mental and consequently physical health, both acutely and chronically. It also highlights the importance of social and psychological support in maintaining the well-being of patients with HIV globally.",

At diagnosis, about one-third of male patients presents with testicular tumours, namely large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumours, which are often multicentric and/or bilateral and have a low malignant potential. Although radical orchiectomy is the gold standard for the treatment of testicular neoplasms, a conservative approach with partial orchiectomy or tumourectomy may be the best treatment option for these patients, allowing the preservation of endocrine function, fertility and body image. We present a case of a 19-year-old man with a known history of Carney complex with early identification of a small testicular tumour treated with organ-sparing surgery.",

        "Abstract": "A 78-year-old man presented to the accident and emergency department with acute abdominal pain. A CT scan done to investigate the pain showed an intra-abdominal abscess medial to the caecum and an incidental exophytic lesion in the gall bladder. This was excised during surgery and sent for histological examination. Histology showed a ciliated foregut cyst of the gall bladder. A literature review revealed that this was the 13th case worldwide, as ciliated foregut cysts are usually found either above the diaphragm or in the liver. It was also the largest cyst described, with 45â€‰mm diameter. So far none of these cysts found in the gall bladder have shown malignant transformation, though those found in the liver have been known to become malignant. Due to histological similarity, excision of ciliated foregut cysts of the gall bladder should be considered as there is still a risk of malignant transformation.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic diseases pose unique social challenges beyond traditional health considerations that require specific attention. In this report, we examine the case of a middle-aged woman with ulcerative colitis, living in Southern Israel. Trust between the patient and physician is shown to positively influence a variety of therapeutic outcomes and should be considered a fundamental component of successful care. In context of the military conflict between Israel and Gaza, the needs of patients with chronic diseases cannot be forgotten. The work environment is also identified as an area of particular concern, as a supportive work environment is essential in order to maintain satisfaction in the workplace and sustain a high quality of life. Out-of-pocket costs for medications are confirmed to be a significant barrier to adherence. Better understanding of patientsâ€™ financial capabilities, along with affordable therapeutic interventions, will alleviate healthcare-related financial burdens and improve health outcomes.",

Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) is an entity of cardiomyopathy which is reversible in 1â€\"2 weeks after recovery from sepsis or septic shock. SICM is thought to have unpredictable cumulative mortality towards sepsis but its exact mechanism remains elusive. We report a case of  SICM in a 63-year-old woman presented with sudden onset of dyspnoea on exertion and orthopnoea following nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after consuming Chinese foods. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severely reduced global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of <20%â€‰which returned back to normal LVEF of 57% after 10 days. Subsequent cardiac catheterisation showed non-obstructive coronaries. No specific therapy intended for reversal of SICM presents to date despite current sepsis survival guideline available for haemodynamic support. Initiation of beta blockers after recovery from septic shock has been beneficial."

He was treated with surgery for spine stabilisation and was actively rehabilitated. Adolescents and teenagers are indulging in high-contact sports like wrestling, without proper training and technical know-how, which can lead to severe injuries and possibly, permanent handicap or death. Trainers, assistants and institutions should be well equipped to diagnose and provide initial care of people with a spinal injury to prevent a partial injury from progressing to complete injury. Athletes, coaches and the public should be aware of methods of first aid and how to transport a patient with a cervical spine injury. Authorities should take steps to improve infrastructures in training institutions and ambulance services. Specialised spinal centres should be established throughout the country for management and rehabilitation of patients with paraplegia.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a case of reproducible asystole during endovascular treatment of a posterior fossa dural arteriovenous fistula. Catheterisation of the posterior meningeal artery, a branch of the vertebral artery in this patient, followed by dimethyl sulfoxide injection prior to Onyx administration resulted in two episodes of asystole.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of asystole occurring during endovascular intervention in the posterior meningeal artery. This may represent a previously undescribed variant of the trigemino-cardiac reflex (TGCR) caused by chemical stimulation of small areas of trigeminally innervated posterior fossa dura. Alternatively, this may represent a newly identified phenomenon with chemical stimulation of regions of posterior fossa dura innervated by branches of the vagus nerve leading to increased parasympathetic activity and resultant asystole.In either case, it is important to recognise the potential for such episodes in this vascular territory to allow case planning and management.",

Symptoms included spinning vertigo lasting for 30's, headache, visual vertigo and disorientation. Clinical examination of balance and vestibular systems confirmed a left posterior canalithiasis benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and excluded other central and peripheral causes of dizziness. Two cycles of a left Epley manoeuvre were performed. An Epley manoeuvre abolished the BPPV and negated the need for medication. The player was able to return to play without dizziness within 24 hours completely symptom free. BPPV can be successfully identified and treated in elite football players and they can see a return to training and games within 24 hours.

        "Abstract": "Holmes' tremor is a low-frequency hand tremor and has varying amplitude at different phases of motion. It is usually unilateral and does not respond satisfactorily to drugs and thus considered irreversible. Structural lesions in the thalamus and brainstem or cerebellum are usually responsible for Holmes' tremor. We present a 23-year-old woman who presented with unilateral Holmes' tremor. She also had hypersomnolence and headache in the sitting posture. Her brain imaging showed brain sagging and deep brain swelling due to spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). She was managed conservatively and had a total clinical and radiological recovery. The brain sagging with the consequent distortion of the midbrain and diencephalon was responsible for this clinical presentation. SIH may be considered as one of the reversible causes of Holmes' tremor.",

        "Abstract": "A 30-year-old man suffered post-traumatic hypothermic cardiac arrest. On arrival in the emergency department, rectal core temperature was 23°C. Manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was continued as no mechanical chest compression device was available, and active and passive rewarming was undertaken. Bilateral thoracostomies confirmed good lung inflation. Defibrillation and intravenous epinephrine were discontinued until core temperature was elevated above 30°C. Extracorporeal rewarming was unavailable. When no increase in rectal temperature was achieved after 90 min, an alternative oesophageal probe confirmed mediastinal temperature as 23°C. Bilateral chest drain insertion, followed by microwave-heated saline pleural lavage, rapidly raised the oesophageal temperature above 30°C with subsequent successful defibrillation, initially to pulseless electrical activity and finally return of spontaneous circulation 3.5 hours after the commencement of CPR. The patient recovered fully and was discharged without neurological deficit. Rapid mediastinal warming with pleural lavage should be considered in units with no access to extracorporeal rewarming service.",

The patient had no history of absence, myoclonus or generalised convulsion. Her seizure was resistant to a combination of antiepileptic drugs including carbamazepine. Ictal positron emission tomography using [F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([F]FDG-PET) revealed hypermetabolism of the bilateral thalamus and cerebellum and hypometabolism of the frontal, parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. We diagnosed her seizure as absence status and obtained remission by changing medication. The findings of ictal metabolic alteration in previous studies and in our case confirm the pathogenic importance of the thalamus in absence status and that associated cortical deactivation and cerebellar activation may be related to the generation or maintenance of epileptic EEG discharges."

        "Abstract": "Stroke is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD). A specific large-vessel vasculopathy is often responsible for both haemorrhagic and ischaemic strokes in patients with SCD. Although intravenous thrombolysis has been considered as a therapeutic option for acute ischaemic strokes in SCD, its use remains debated because of an increased risk of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage reported in this disease. This risk of haemorrhage is mainly supported by the presence of a Moyamoya syndrome often associated with the specific vasculopathy in patients with homozygous SCD. We report two cases of patients with homozygous SCD treated with intravenous thrombolysis for an acute ischaemic stroke without haemorrhagic transformation. Our cases suggest that reperfusion strategy in acute ischaemic stroke in patients with homozygous SCD can be considered once associated Moyamoya syndrome has been ruled out. An international registry would be of interest as these situations are rare.",

On examination he was found to have an isolated partial left abducens palsy with no other neurological deficits. Despite having microvascular risk factors, given his history of prostate cancer, aMRI brain scan was requested to look for a neurological cause. The scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the clivus encasing the cavernous sinus and carotid artery. He was referred to his oncologist for further management, however he opted out of further treatment and succumbed to his illness a month later. This case report includes a literature review of cases with clivus metastases secondary to prostate cancer. It highlights the importance of carefully examining eye movements and having a high index of suspicion for the subtlest sign that may suggest brain metastases in elderly patients with prostate cancer with prolonged survival.",

Some of the challenges are due to ectopic parathyroid adenomas, including thymic, intrathyroidal, carotid sheath and mediastinal glands, and others are because of supernumerary glands. While uncommon in PHPT, multigland disease is also an important consideration in patients requiring reoperative surgery for persistent disease. For this reason, localisation studies including sestamibi, ultrasound, CT scan and venous sampling for abnormal glands may be an essential component of the preoperative workup.

She made a complete clinical and biochemical recovery and was discharged on day 9 postoperatively. This case illustrates a diagnostic challenge of a serious life-threatening complication of diabetes in the postoperative period associated with a novel class of antidiabetic medications, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.",

A bedside echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with features concerning for pericardial tamponade. A left anterior thoracotomy and a pericardial window were emergently performed in the operating room and relieved the patient's symptoms. Histology evaluation of the pericardial fragments and pericardial fluid revealed the presence of trilineage haematopoietic elements without any increase in the blasts. A bone marrow core biopsy revealed an increase in reticulin fibre and increase in the number of blasts of 5%-10%, whereas peripheral blood testing was positive for JAK2 V617F mutation.

On clinical examination, she had hepatosplenomegaly. Ultrasonography revealed hepatosplenomegaly with fusiform dilatation of extrahepatic portal vein, which was confirmed to be portal vein aneurysm on contrast enhanced CT. Though portal vein aneurysms were previously thought to be rare, recently they are increasingly diagnosed with the use of cross-sectional imaging. Recognition of this finding can help to avoid potential confusion with other periportal cystic masses of different aetiologies, especially on sonography.",

An infarct in the left anterior inferior cerebellar artery territory was later confirmed on CT. She continued to have recurrent febrile episodes associated with vomiting and dyspnoea. Extensive investigations for infection were negative, and her symptoms were initially attributed to aspiration pneumonia. The patient gradually deteriorated despite antibiotics and became progressively short of breath, with development of large pleural and pericardial effusions.

Bilateral adrenal myelolipomas, in particular, may be associated with underlying endocrinopathies associated with elevated circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration. Subclinical cortisol hypersecretion, irrespective of its ACTH dependency, does not manifest typical clinical phenotype of hypercortisolemia, and thus termed subclinical Cushing's syndrome. In this article, hormonal evaluation in a middle-aged woman with diabetes, hypertension and incidentally discovered unilateral adrenal myelolipoma revealed underlying subclinical Cushing's disease. Abdominal CT revealed another tiny focus in the contralateral adrenal gland, probably representing incipient myelolipoma.",

Uncontrolled hypertension with RAS can cause progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to end-stage kidney disease. Therapeutic revascularisation can be helpful in appropriate circumstances where pharmaceutical intervention has failed and significant renovascular disease contributes to resistant hypertension. We present an interesting case of a Caucasian male with peripheral vasculopathy, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), single functioning kidney and ostial RAS caused by stent struts from an endovascular AAA stent graft. He had escalating medications requirement, with repeated failed attempts at percutaneous radiological intervention that led to an episode of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), before undergoing successful surgical revascularisation by a splenic artery transposition graft to the left renal artery that was performed to improve kidney function and the blood pressure.

Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) is an important mediator of normal thrombi formation and indirect evidence suggests that vWF may play an important role in Shiga toxin-induced thrombi formation. Clinical evidence supporting the role of vWF in STEC-HUS is lacking. A 10-year-old girl with type 1 von Willebrand Disease (vWD) had a mild case of STEC-HUS, with nadir haemoglobin 7.3 g/dL and platelet count 105×10 cells/L and peak serum creatinine 0.56 mg/L and lactate dehydrogenase 741 U/L. This is the first report of STEC-HUS in a patient with vWD. We speculate that the quantitative deficiency of vWF associated with type 1 vWD may have attenuated the course of disease by reducing platelet aggregation, complement activation and thrombi formation. This case adds to a growing literature supporting a link between vWF and STEC-HUS."

The aetiology was embolic, with an echocardiogram revealing vegetations on the aortic valve. The patient was treated empirically for 6 weeks with amoxicillin and gentamicin for endocarditis. Eight months later, she had an elective aortic valve replacement for symptomatic aortic regurgitation. The valve was culture negative but analysis by 16S rDNA PCR was positive for  In retrospect, the ulnar artery aneurysm and a history of arthralgia were attributed to an underlying diagnosis of Whipple's endocarditis. She continues on antibiotic treatment with resolution of her arthralgia and no clinical signs of infection. Once thought to be rare entity, molecular assays have revolutionised the diagnosis of Whipple's endocarditis, but this case highlights the difficulties and pitfalls in diagnosis."

        "Abstract": "A 47-year-old man attended the emergency department following trauma during sexual intercourse after which he developed penile swelling and haematuria several hours later. A penile fracture was suspected but given the slightly atypical history, ultrasound was performed to look for a fracture. Given the history of haematuria, both a standard Doppler ultrasound and a microbubble-enhanced retrograde ultrasound urethrogram were performed. The Doppler confirmed the suspected diagnosis of penile fracture, and microbubble urethrogram demonstrated a urethral injury. This facilitated prompt surgical treatment and helped guide the surgical approach. Retrograde microbubble enhanced ultrasound urethrogram is a novel technique that can be used in conjunction with standard ultrasound to confirm the presence of a concurrent urethral rupture in penile fracture.",

        "Abstract": "Disseminated cutaneous varicella herpes zoster with visceral involvement is rare and seen almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients. We describe an unusual case of fulminant herpes zoster (HZ) in a healthy, immunocompetent 37-year-old woman. She initially presented to an urgent care centre with a classic HZ rash localised to her neck, and upper respiratory symptoms and was treated with prednisone and cephalexin. Within 1 week, the rash became diffuse and her clinical status rapidly deteriorated with development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Varicella zoster infection was confirmed via skin biopsy, bronchial viral PCR and serology for varicella antibodies. She was successfully treated with intravenous acyclovir and aggressive supportive care. Though physicians readily recognise typical zoster infection, this case reminds clinicians that HZ infection can be fulminant and potentially life-threatening in younger, immunocompetent individuals. Early recognition and antiviral therapy is important to reduce morbidity and mortality.",

He presented to us with shortness of breath and altered sensorium and was found to have fMetHb (fraction of methaemoglobin) level of 80%, which has been postulated to have a fatal outcome. He responded to a low dose of methylene blue along with intravenous vitamin C and the level of fMetHb came down to 20% within 1 hour. His sensorium improved markedly with a decrease in fMetHb to non-toxic levels and he was discharged 5 days after admission.

A Focussed Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scan performed in the emergency department suggested intra-abdominal free fluid, and subsequent head and abdominal CT imaging showed no intracranial lesion but confirmed a significant haemoperitoneum due to large splenic tear and bleeding. An emergency splenectomy was performed, which confirmed the rupture of an enlarged spleen with blood loss of almost 2 L into the peritoneal cavity. The patient made a full recovery following surgery. A subsequent histological examination revealed granulomatous inflammation characteristic of infectious mononucleosis. This unique case illustrates that physically fit patients with early hypovolaemic shock can present with symptoms mimicking concussion.",

        "Abstract": "We report a case in which an intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) developed after endovascular treatment of a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with venous sinus stenting (VSS). The pathogenesis may involve hemodynamic alterations secondary to increased poststenting venous sinus pressure, which may cause new arterial ingrowth into the fistulous sinus wall without capillary interposition. Despite administration of dual antiplatelet therapy, there may also be subclinical cortical vein thrombosis that contributed to DAVF formation. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, increased inflammation induced by VSS may upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor expression and also promote DAVF pathogenesis. Since VSS has been used to obliterate DAVFs, DAVF formation after VSS may seem counterintuitive. Previous stents have generally been closed cell, stainless steel designs used to maximize radial compression of the fistulous sinus wall. In contrast, our patient's stent was an open cell, self-expandable nitinol design (Protégé Everflex). Neurointerventionalists should be aware of this potential, although rare complication of DAVF formation after VSS.",

        "Abstract": "Several hepatobiliary disorders have been reported in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) being the most specific. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis, rarely occurs in UC. We present two PBC cases of 67 and 71 years who suffered from long-standing UC. Both patients were asymptomatic but they had increased cholestatic enzymes and high titres of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA)-the laboratory hallmark of PBC. After careful exclusion of other causes of cholestasis by MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), virological and microbiological investigations, a diagnosis of PBC associated with UC was established. The patients started ursodeoxycholic acid (13 mg/kg/day) with complete response. During follow-up, both patients remained asymptomatic with normal blood biochemistry. Although PSC is the most common hepatobiliary manifestation among patients with UC, physicians must keep also PBC in mind in those with unexplained cholestasis and repeatedly normal MRCP. In these cases, a reliable AMA testing can help for an accurate diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "We describe an unusual presentation of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare neuroendocrine cutaneous tumour. A 59-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of dyspnoea on a background of MCC of the left elbow that was diagnosed after an axillary lymph node metastasis had appeared. He was clinically diagnosed with cardiac tamponade and received urgent pericardiocentesis. Thoracic CT imaging revealed a large infiltrating mass within the inferior aspect of the heart, confirmed to be MCC via immunohistochemistry of the pericardial fluid. On review of prior fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging, avid uptake was evident at the corresponding site of disease. This case has several important illustrative aspects, including the clinical manifestations of cardiac metastases, the challenges of MCC histopathological diagnosis and the role of imaging (in particular FDG-PET) in this aggressive disease.",

SLVA is well recognised but rare. Incidence of SLVA in Malay has never been documented. This is the first reported case of SLVA in Malays with concomitant thoracic aorta mycotic aneurysm. TB has been reported to be associated with SLVA. Treatment is either surgical or conservative. Imaging is required for diagnosis and preoperative assessment. Multimodality imaging include echocardiography (ECHO), cardiac CTangiography and the robust multiparametric cardiac MR (CMR). ECHO is the first line imaging and useful for initial detection of the aneurysm. CMR including the late gadolinium enhancement allows excellent visualisation of the LV aneurysm, tissue characterisation, cardiac function and detection of associated pathology as shown in this case.",

This Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), also presenting with symptoms from the autism spectrum and a higher risk of developing seizure disorders, may be caused by a deletion of chromosome 22q13 or by a mutation in the  gene. Its core psychopathological phenotype comprises symptoms from the bipolar spectrum for which generally treatment with a mood-stabilising anticonvulsant in combination with an atypical antipsychotic seems to be most effective. In addition to two elsewhere published adolescent patients, we here describe in detail the history of an adult male patient with PMS caused by a  mutation in whom successive treatment regimens with antipsychotics and mood-stabilising anticonvulsants were all ineffective. Ultimately, addition of lithium to existing olanzapine therapy led to enduring stabilisation of mood and behaviour."

We wish to present a unique case of a 79-year-old man with respiratory distress following a fall from standing, initially managed as a haemothorax. After a chest drain was placed, bowel contents were drained from the pleural cavity and he was taken to theatre. He had a history of minimally invasive oesophagectomy for cancer and had subsequently developed a diaphragmatic hernia. A blind ending diverticulum with a perforation at its tip was found in the left oblique lung fissure that was subsequently confirmed histologically as a perforated Meckel's diverticulum. The patient had a prolonged stay on the intensive care unit with a left-sided empyema that was managed radiologically prior to discharge. Unfortunately 4 months postoperatively, he passed away from hospital-acquired pneumonia on a rehabilitation ward.",

        "Abstract": "A Caucasian 24-year-old female patient suffers from two hereditary disorders: alpha-thalassaemia, which is prevalent in Asia and rare in Europe, and haemochromatosis, which is prevalent among northern Europe and rare in Asia. The clinical presentation and management of one of these diseases is controversial for the other. She presented 5 years ago with a clinical picture of refractory iron-deficiency anaemia secondary to menorrhagia. On treating her with the standard iron therapy, her anaemia persists although with adquate iron stores. This prompted further investigations that revealed in addition to hereditary haemochromatosis, alpha-thalassaemia because of abnormal blood indices. The treatment of thalassaemia with either iron or blood transfusion is not advisable in haemochromatosis, while standard treatment of haemochromatosis with venesection will worsen the anaemia. As iron chelating agents were not approved in Australia for haemochromatosis, haematinics support was commenced with a satisfactory improvement of anaemia thus allowing for further venesection.",

        "Abstract": "Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) migration into azygos vein (AV) is a rare complication. It is recognised only when catheter malfunction occurs or when patients develop associated complications. PICC migration into AV has been reported to be associated with various complications such as catheter malfunction, perforation, haemorrhage, thrombosis, infection and stenosis of AV. Pleural effusion and trachea-azygos fistulas have also been reported. We present a patient with recurrent migration of PICC into AV after an initial corrective repositioning during the same hospital stay. In this case, PICC migration was possibly related to left-sided approach, use of smaller diameter PICC, severe congestive heart failure and her bedbound status. PICC migration should be considered when PICC found be malfunctioning, especially if associated with the above risk factors.",

Here, we describe a 14-year-old white boy who developed an erythematous rash on both cheeks before the age of 3 months and was noted to have absent eyelashes and scanty eyebrows. He was found to have compound heterozygous mutations of the  gene alleles at the age of 6 months and was diagnosed to have RTS type II.

He had debilitating pain at the scalp and spine. Prior work up was unrevealing. The patient resided in the upper Midwest region of the USA and worked outdoors, optimising the landscape for white tailed deer. Repeat cerebrospinal fluid testing revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis and positive IgM Lyme serology. Brain MRI demonstrated enhancement of multiple cranial nerves bilaterally. He was diagnosed with early Lyme neuroborreliosis and treated with 28 days of intravenous ceftriaxone. While the painful meningoradiculitis, also known as Bannwarth syndrome, is more commonly seen in Europe, facial palsy is more frequently encountered in the USA. Clinical manifestations of neuroborreliosis are important to recognise as the classic presentation varies by geography and on occasion repeat serological testing may be necessary.",

The previously fit and well 32-year-old man first presented with serpiginous, pruriginous erythematous tracks characteristic of cutaneous larva migrans shortly after returning from South-East Asia. He was systemically well with no other symptoms. After ivermectin therapy, he re-presented with respiratory symptoms, peripheral eosinophilia and transient pulmonary infiltrates; the classic triad of Löffler's syndrome associated with invasive helminth infection.  immunoblot was positive. After a second round of ivermectin therapy his respiratory symptoms resolved, but the patient's cutaneous disease relapsed repeatedly over months, with migratory erythematous swellings appearing and settling after a few days. He was treated with a 21-day course of albendazole and is lesion free at 40 weeks post initial presentation."

        "Abstract": "We report an unusual case of an elderly man presenting with a fast-growing large malignant tumour involving the skin overlying his permanent pacemaker site. The fast-growing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma appeared 2 years after pacemaker implantation. Joint specialist input was required to tackle this complex problem as a wide surgical excision would expose the pacemaker generator risking device infection particularly if the skin graft reconstruction failed. Having established that the patient had minimal pacing needs, it was determined through expedited multidisciplinary discussion that the best option was excision of the lesion with skin grafting of the defect by maxillofacial surgical team and pacemaker generator removal by a cardiologist in a joint surgical procedure. The procedure was successful and uneventful. This case highlights how effective multidisciplinary planning can help achieve a favourable clinical outcome in a patient with a rare case of a squamous cell carcinoma overlying a pacemaker site.",

The ECG revealed a mild ST-segment elevation in inferior leads, followed by positive myocardial necrosis biomarkers. Attending to the high cardiovascular risk profile, ST-segment elevation in inferior territory and wall motion abnormalities, a coronary angiogram was performed. The latter showed a three-vessel CAD, 60% stenosis in midanterior descending artery, total occlusion (100%) of the obtuse marginal artery and 99% stenosis with high thrombi burden in the proximal right coronary artery.The present case report emphasises the plausibility of premature CAD in patients with PWS, a possible underdiagnosed feature of this condition.",

A testicular ultrasound scan was subsequently organised that showed detailed appearances consistent with bilateral testicular torsion. This was thought to have taken place antenatally and as such was unfortunately not suitable for intervention. The patient was therefore managed conservatively with the testicles left to involute naturally. He was started on testosterone replacement therapy after follow-up when gonadotrophin levels were found to be raised and testosterone low (suggesting absent testicular function) and will be closely followed up regarding his future development which is normal to this point.",

She denied chest pain or dyspnoea. Patient was haemodynamically stable. There was no pulsus paradoxus. Laboratories showed leucocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. CT abdomen and pelvis showed a large pericardial effusion (PE). Shortly after admission, she developed AF with rapid ventricular response, responsive to intravenous amiodarone. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed 2.4 cm posterior PE without tamponade physiology, non-amenable to pericardiocentesis via sub-xiphoid approach. Patient underwent left thoracoscopic pericardial window with removal of 250 cc bloody fibrinous fluid. Cough improved significantly and she was discharged on oral amiodarone and apixaban. Repeat CT chest after 2 weeks for recurrent cough showed a small PE, treated with oral prednisone for suspected postablation pericarditis, with complete resolution of cough.

        "Abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of a corresponding external acoustic stimulus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Tinnitus may be classified as pulsatile (PT) or continuous (non-PT), and may be subjective (heard only by the patient) or objective (also audible to the examiner). PT is usually related to vascular causes and is pulse synchronous (coinciding with the patient's heartbeat). PT is much less common affecting approximately 4% of patients with tinnitus, but unlike non-PT, usually has a specific identifiable cause. We present a case of a man without previous otological disease or head trauma, with a left-ear subjective PT. MR angiography detected a left vertebro-vertebral arteriovenous fistula, which was treated by endovascular embolisation with important symptomatic relief.",

Rituximab has been emerging as an alternative therapeutic option.We describe a case of a young patient with MCD that had frequent relapses and steroid dependency, with no response to several immunosuppressive agents during 15 years of disease. He was kept under high-dose steroids and ciclosporin. He started treatment with rituximab (two administrations of 1 g 2 weeks apart, repeating after 6 months). The steroids dose was gradually reduced and the ciclosporin was stopped. During the entire 2 years follow-up period, he remained in remission and had no adverse events.This remarkable outcome reinforces the option of using rituximab in difficult cases, allowing the reduction of steroid burden and its adverse effects, which is of extreme importance, especially in young patients.",

        "Abstract": "Hypertrophiccardiomyopathy (HCM) is common, whereas the decision not to have an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) when probably falling into a 'high-risk' category is not. A solicitor aged 45 years attended the inherited cardiac conditions clinic for review of her HCM and discussion about ICD implantation for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Despite a predicted 7% risk of SCD within the next 5 years, according to the European Society of Cardiology endorsed HCM Risk-SCD risk stratification tool, the patient opted against implantation of an ICD and comprehensively justifies her decision. This report discusses ethical aspects of a consultation offering ICD protection against SCD in the context of HCM and emphasises the clinicians' role in respecting patient autonomy.",

        "Abstract": "Hyponatraemia is common following major head injury and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A 20-year-old man presented with reduced consciousness after head trauma and was found to have a fractured skull base with bilateral frontal contusions. On day 3 of his admission, he developed hyponatraemia with raised urine sodium and osmolality, despite receiving dexamethasone and intravenous fluid therapy. His hyponatraemia worsened after the treatment with fluid restriction and oral salt. He was in negative fluid balance suggesting possible renal salt wasting. A trial of isotonic normal saline resulted in a further fall in serum sodium level. He was subsequently treated for suspected syndrome of inappropriate ADH with a hypertonic (3%) saline infusion. His sodium level and neurological status improved. This case report illustrates the confounding factors that commonly affect clinical decision-making when treating patients with hyponatraemia following head injury. The guidelines for diagnosis and management are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Postoperative neuropathic pain exacerbated by movement is poorly understood and difficult to treat but a relatively common complication of surgical procedures such as endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy. Here, we describe a case of unexpected, immediate, complete and sustained remission of postoperative intercostal neuralgia after the patient engaged in an open-water swim in markedly cold conditions. Though an incidental chance association is possible, the clear temporal proximity linking the swim with pain remission makes a causal relationship possible. We discuss plausible mechanisms that may underlie the relationship and discuss the potential implications for postoperative pain management and patient-centred mobilisation. We recommend further evaluation of cold forced open-water swimming as a mobility-pain provocation challenge to see if the observed unexpectedly positive outcome can be replicated. With the poor response to traditional management, there is a need for novel, curative interventions for postoperative neuropathic pain and associated impaired mobility.",

Significant changes in pharmacokinetics and drug interactions may be due to induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Rifampicin is a common inducer of CYP3A4. We report a case of a 57-year-old woman who was suspected for endocarditis and therefore treated with rifampicin. Due to previous mechanical aortic valve replacement, she also received phenprocoumon for anticoagulation. Although continuing anticoagulant therapy, antibiotic coadministration led to normal international normalised ratio (INR) level.

While homozygotes typically experience more dramatic bleeding symptoms, heterozygotes may experience clinically significant bleeding following surgical procedures or trauma, and therefore the condition is not purely recessive. The clinical significance of FXI deficiency is complicated in that FXI levels do not correlate well with bleeding severity, and in fact the bleeding risk is variable even for an individual in response to different haemostatic challenges. We present the case of a 74-year-old man of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage with a family and personal history of bleeding during surgical procedures, who presented with excessive bleeding following total thyroidectomy. He was found to have a FXI level of 52% (low normal). Genetic testing revealed that he was heterozygous for the c.403G>T mutation.

        "Abstract": "A 33-year-old, 8-week pregnant woman presented with mottling, pain and swelling of her left leg. Ultrasound Doppler scan revealed a large left iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis and the patient was diagnosed with phlegmasia cerulea dolens. After 24 hours of treatment with unfractionated heparin, there were minimal improvements in her symptoms. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was performed, following multidisciplinary consultation with the patient. An underlying May-Thurner lesion was identified and successfully stented. Radiation exposure to the fetus was minimised with the use of intravenous ultrasound and very low-dose fluoroscopy. Total radiation exposure to the fetus is 1.38 mGy, which is equivalent to 8 months of background radiation exposure. No immediate complication occurred and patient's symptoms completely resolved. On further follow-up, her iliofemoral veins remained patent with good flow and there were no recurrence of symptoms. A healthy infant was successfully delivered at 40 weeks gestation.",

The objective of this study was to determine if combination imiquimod and photodynamic therapy could induce remission of EMPD. A 69-year-old man with EMPD was treated with topical imiquimod 5% cream at night for 5 days per week for 1 month, followed by 2 months of 5% imiquimod for three nights a week. For the following 6 months, monthly 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy was added. After 6 months, imiquimod was discontinued and the patient continued to be treated with quarterly photodynamic therapy. Treatment resulted in significant improvement in the appearance of the lesion, and pathology revealed no evidence of residual disease. The patient has had no clinical signs of disease for >5 years. We conclude that topical imiquimod 5% cream and photodynamic therapy may aid in the treatment of some patients with EMPD.",

Her pregnancy was uneventful until 31 weeks gestation when she presented with dyspnoea. On examination and investigation, she had oedema, bilateral pleural effusions and ascites. Multidisciplinary discussions involving surgery, anaesthesia, obstetrics, neonatology and medicine were held. A consensus outpatient and inpatient management plan was implemented. At 36 weeks, following non-reassuring fetal cardiotocography, she underwent induction of labour. An assisted vacuum delivery was conducted in a controlled setting. She gave birth to a live female infant who had an APGAR score of 9 at 5 min. Both she and the baby had an uneventful postpartum period.",

Early symptoms are non-specific, including easy fatigability, myalgia, arthralgia and Raynaud's phenomenon. Some reports emphasised the favourable outcome and excellent response to glucocorticoids, but there are contradictory studies reporting worse prognosis. Also, a subset of patients evolve into a clinical picture more consistent with a major diffuse connective tissue disease. We present the case of a 50-year-old black woman whose inaugural presentation of MCDT was oropharyngeal dysphagia, symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, tongue atrophy and skin sclerosis. High-dose corticosteroids and methotrexate were given with little improvement, maintaining disabling dysphagia leading to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. She was then started on intravenous immunoglobulin with progressive remission of symptoms.",

Mammogram revealed a 2.4 cm spiculated mass. Initial pathology was inconclusive; however, right-sided simple mastectomy showed invasive metaplastic carcinoma with adenosquamous histology. He received adjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles of dose dense Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide followed by 12 weeks of paclitaxel and chest wall radiation. Although oestrogen receptor status was 1%, tamoxifen was not given due to recent diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Two years after treatment, he is currently living with no signs of recurrence.

The causes include trauma, inflammation, ischaemia, genetics and changes at secondary ossification centres. The case report presents a 27-year-old man with chronic intermittent left knee pain for about 3 years. He typically develops the symptom after prolonged standing or when rising from a prolonged seated position. An initial MRI scan in 2014 did not identify and report an OCD that was present in his left lateral tibial plateau. It was only after an accidental tibial fracture injury this year that the defect was incidentally detected on a scan. OCD can be staged based on MRI and/or arthroscopic findings. The treatment can be either non-operative or operative, but this largely depends on the age of the patient, the severity of symptoms and the staging of the defect.",

In this case report, immersive virtual reality (VR) technology was adopted as a therapy tool in a patient with stroke with severe near and far space neglect. Neuropsychological tests in near and far space as well as the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS), as an index of neglect in daily living, were measured preintervention and postintervention. Improvement of neuropsychological tests, particularly in far space, was clearly demonstrated postintervention. However, CBS score did not change postintervention. This may be because the patient unsuccessfully translated these visual search task skills used in far space to activities of daily living. Our findings suggest the potential use of immersive VR technology in patients with USN and highlight the VR programme's limited ability to fully recover a patient's disability in natural settings.",

We herein report a case of chronic back pain, which took about 5 years to get accurately diagnosed. The case challenges the diagnostic assumptions and sets ground of discussion for the diagnostic reasoning pitfalls and heuristic biases that mislead the caring physicians and cost years of low quality of life to our patient. This case serves as an example of how anchoring heuristics can interfere in the diagnostic process of a complex and rare entity when combined with a concurrent potentially life-threatening condition.",

        "Abstract": "Neurogenic tumours of the mediastinum in adults occur most often at the posterior mediastinum, majority of which are benign of nerve sheath in origin. A 72-year-old woman, known asthmatic, presented with chronic symptoms of hoarseness, dysphagia, chest heaviness, easy fatigability, cough, epigastric pain, feeling of abdominal fullness and choking with food intake and at a supine position. Treated for other disorders, routine chest X-ray incidentally found a homogenous convex radiodensity at the right paratracheal area; mass which was also observed with CT and 18F-fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT scan studies. Mediastinoscopy with biopsy showed spindle to plump cells with strong S100 positivity. Thoracoscopic surgery done to completely excise the mass found it to be benign schwannoma.",

        "Abstract": "The optimal treatment for patients with chronic symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) total occlusion is not well established. In addition to medical therapy, vessel recanalisation with stenting has shown much promise, especially for patients with recurrent ischemic symptoms. Nevertheless, the incidence of symptomatic in-stent restenosis (ISR) is high, and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Drug coated balloons (DCBs) have been proven to be effective in treating and preventing ISR. However, the feasibility of DCBs for de novo intracranial atherothrombotic stenosis has not been previously described, especially for total occlusion lesions. Here we reported a patient with chronic left MCA total occlusion successfully treated with DCBs, with a good outcome at the 1 year follow-up. More studies are warranted to further compare the efficacy of DCBs and stentings for intracranial revascularisation.",

Cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis represents the most common extrapulmonary presentation of TB in the USA. Considerations for other causes of neck mass often contribute to delay in diagnosis. In this report, we describe the case of a 41-year-old man who presented with painful swelling of the neck and was diagnosed with tuberculous lymphadenitis, complicated by HIV therapy-associated immune reconstitution syndrome. Prior to this diagnosis, he presented with a chronic intermittent cough, repeatedly treated as bronchitis. Furthermore, TB is a recognised occupational risk for primary care physician, as they are often the first contact for patients. With the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the USA, the risk is likely to increase with the influx of newly insured often poor,and/or immigrants.",

The pustules burst 2 days prior to admission, causing blood and pus to come out. As a result, the evaluation of eye movement, visual acuity and intraocular pressure was hindered. Eyelids were spasming, hyperaemic, warm and of soft consistency on palpation. Crust and necrotic tissues were also observed. The patient had a history of fever with cough and nasal congestion. CT scan revealed soft tissue thickening on bilateral anterolateral periorbital region. She also underwent debridement in both eyelids, followed by partial periosteal graft on the left eye due to corneal perforation. During follow-up after 1.5 months, she also underwent excision of the periosteal graft and synechiolysis, followed by cataract extraction of the left eye.",

Presence of an LVAD or heart failure, however, can cause physicians to perceive these patients to be at prohibitively high risk for elective surgery. Nevertheless, as one of the most common causes of poor vision in the elderly, cataracts can significantly limit improvements in quality of life that a patient may have otherwise gained from LVAD support. We describe the case of a 62-year-old man with an LVAD who underwent two uncomplicated sequential cataract surgeries following extensive cardiology evaluations and intraoperative monitoring by anaesthesia without intravenous sedation. The patient reported significant improvement in visual acuity and quality of life. Our case demonstrates the potential benefits of conducting cataract surgery relatively early in the disease course in patients with LVAD devices.",

        "Abstract": "We present a 19-year-old man with a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and a delayed presentation of testicular torsion. EDS is a rare and heterogeneous condition affecting collagen synthesis and presents multiple difficulties in a surgical setting. Management of this case of testicular torsion was complicated by impaired cognition of the patient, difficulty with intubation, a contralateral undescended testis and postoperative bleeding. We discuss the specific challenges faced in this case of testicular torsion with longstanding ischaemia and perioperative considerations of EDS.",

        "Abstract": "An 80-year-old woman presented to our department with visible haematuria and stage II acute kidney injury (AKI). She had stage IIB cervical cancer, for which she received chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy in 2003. Four years later, she had a left dynamic hip screw for an extracapsular neck of femur fracture following a fall. In 2010, she underwent a right total hip replacement owing to osteoarthritis, and it was subsequently revised in 2012 owing to a right acetabular component failure. In this admission, her AKI improved with intravenous fluid administration and her haematuria settled following catheterisation with a three-way catheter and bladder irrigation with saline. She underwent a flexible cystoscopy which revealed that a part of her right hip prosthesis was in the bladder, having eroded through the right bony pelvis. However, she declined any surgical interventions.",

        "Abstract": "A 13-month-old boy with sickle cell disease (SCD) from Equatorial Guinea, who had recently arrived in Spain, presented with fever. He had suffered from malaria and had received a blood transfusion. Following physical examination and complementary tests, intravenous antibiotics and a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion were administered. Soon after a second transfusion 5 days later, the haemoglobin level fell below pretransfusion levels, together with reticulocytopenia, and haematuria-the so-called hyperhaemolysis syndrome-requiring intensive care and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins and corticosteroids, with resolution of the complication. We want to emphasise the importance of suspecting this rare, though severe complication that can appear after any RBC transfusion especially in patients with SCD, as the clinical syndrome can simulate other more common complications of these patients and a further transfusion is contraindicated. There is no standardised treatment, but intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids are usually effective.",

Postpartum imaging assessment with technetium (Tc)-sestamibi scintigraphy could not supply conclusive diagnostic results. The use of F-fluorocholine (FCH) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT provided the accurate localisation of an ectopic parathyroid adenoma in the anterior mediastinum which was successfully resected by a thoracoscopic approach. In the second case, Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy was inconclusive as well and FCH-PET/CT localised an ectopic parathyroid adenoma in the mediastinum and thus bilateral neck exploration could be spared.

The infant was stable initially on nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation; however, torrential pulmonary flow through a large patent ductus arteriosus prompted closure using oral ibuprofen. After an episode of haematochezia, she developed PI, affecting mainly the gastric wall and small intestine with portal venous gas. Her bowel movements were regular, with no abdominal distension or significant gastric aspirates. She was haemodynamically stable with negative infective markers. Management consisted of endotracheal intubation and ventilation, gastric decompression and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Both the gastric and intestinal pneumatosis resolved within 24 hours and she made an uneventful recovery. If PI is not due to necrotising enterocolitis, enteral nutrition can be initiated early and prolonged course of broad-spectrum antibiotics could have been avoided.",

Concurrent epidermoid cyst within the accessory spleen is an exceedingly rare entity. The patient initially presented with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Imaging studies revealed a 3.6 cm cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas that was concerning for a mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN). The patient underwent a robotic distal pancreatectomy for a suspected diagnosis of MCN, which following histologically examination was found to be an epidermoid cyst of an intrapancreatic accessory spleen. Further imaging characteristics are needed to characterise and differentiate these lesions from those of malignant potential. Robotic distal pancreatectomy is a safe alternative with many benefits including decreased length of stay and decreased blood loss.",

        "Abstract": "Routine imaging for mediastinal malignancies includes chest X-ray, CT or MRI. T1 and T2 mapping are novel MRI techniques which may have a role in expanding the assessment of internal tumour characteristics. This case report details two middle-aged women who had similar clinical presentations of mediastinal masses of comparable size and appearance when assessed with routine imaging. T1 and T2 maps were acquired on MRI to investigate whether these tumours could be further differentiated prior to surgery. T1 and T2 mapping supported suspicion for which tumour components were solid and cystic, as subsequently confirmed histologically. Furthermore, comparison between the two tumours showed native T1 values differed within the solid components by 37%, correlating to differences in proteinaceous material within the tumour types. This radiological-pathological correlation provides evidence that T1 and T2 mapping has clinical utility in the assessment and differentiation of mediastinal masses.",

Neurosurgery did not recommend acute neurosurgical intervention given the lack of a compressive lesion. Aspiration of the paraspinal collection by interventional radiology subsequently showed crystals consistent with tophaceous gout. Given the high initial suspicion for gout and results of the paraspinal aspiration, the patient was started on prolonged steroid taper as well as allopurinol and colchicine.

Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan revealed huge bilateral adrenal masses with intense 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose avidity. Biopsy and immunohistochemical staining were compatible with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The patient received six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) followed by four cycles of intrathechal methotrexate chemotherapy. Bone marrow aspiration biopsy was performed for initial staging and also before bone marrow transplantation. Follow-up PET/CT scan after completion of chemotherapy and before bone marrow transplantation demonstrated complete metabolic response with no evidence of abnormal metabolic activity in either adrenal gland or bone marrow. MCL has an aggressive nature and is usually considered incurable; however, there have been a few reports indicating favourable treatment response when MCL is rarely arising from the adrenal glands. Dramatic response of a primary adrenal MCL to R-CHOP is documented in this case.",

A 53-year-old woman with hypermobile EDS underwent bilateral total knee replacement (TKR) due to valgus osteoarthritis. During follow-up, she developed hypermobility of both knee replacements. Revision of the insert resolved the issue in her left knee; however, the right TKR required two insert exchanges and unfortunately instability persisted. Therefore, a revision to a constrained prosthesis was performed. Insert exchanges in an unstable TKR can give short-term benefits, but for the long-term, we would recommend a constrained prosthesis.",

In 2007, the patient received a renal transplant and started receiving tacrolimus (Tac); the transplant subsequently failed. In April 2015, the patient restarted haemodialysis and in May initiated sofosbuvir 400 mg and ribavirin 400 mg daily. Baseline Tac level was 6.6 ng/mL and haemoglobin (Hb) was 10.3 g/dL. The patient then left the country for vacation and Hb was found to be dramatically low at 3.7 g/dL on return on 5 August. Ribavirin was put on hold, while darbepoetin dose was increased. On 23 August, Tac level was found undetectable; hence, dosage was increased. Hb eventually bounced back to >10 g/dL in October and Tac to 7.2 ng/mL; ribavirin was restarted at 200 mg three times weekly. HCV RNA level was undetectable at 3 months and remained undetectable 12 weeks after therapy finished.",

A misdiagnosis or delay in management can result in lethal maternal-fetal outcomes. We present a 30-year-old woman at 21 weeks of pregnancy presented with abdominal pain. She had a history of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed 3 years earlier. The clinical examination was remarkable for epigastric pain and tenderness. The vital signs and laboratory examinations were unremarkable. The CT scan was suggestive of an internal hernia. On an exploratory laparoscopy, the distal common small bowel was found to be herniating through the jejunojejunostomy mesenteric defect, causing intestinal obstruction with dilatation of the Roux limb and the biliopancreatic limb. The internal hernia was reduced, and no bowel resection was required. The mesenteric defect was closed with 3-0 silk sutures in a continuous fashion. The patient was discharged after 3 days and delivered a healthy baby at 40 weeks of gestation.",

Past medical history included severe emphysema and a chronic right upper lobe (RUL) cavity. He was discharged from follow-up a year ago in view of clinical and radiological stability; previous bronchoscopic examinations yielded no specific diagnosis. CT scan on admission confirmed complex cavitary consolidation of RUL. He developed massive haemoptysis requiring intubation and ventilation. CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) revealed 16 mm RUL pulmonary artery (PA) aneurysm which was successfully embolized. Sputum cultures, aspergillus antigen and rapidity of clinical progression suggested a diagnosis of subacute invasive aspergillosis (SAIA), prompting treatment with Voriconazole. Bronchoscopy showed blood ooze from RUL even after embolization. Unfortunately, patient continued to deteriorate and succumbed to profound septicaemia.",

He reported long-term malaise, fatigue and physical discomfort. Diarrhoea, vomiting, over-the-counter drugs, dietary supplements and any kind of medical abuse were all denied. Physical examination was normal. Suppressed plasma renin activity along with a low aldosterone level and elevated urinary cortisone/cortisol metabolite excretion ratio raised the suspicion of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME). The patient started treatment with spironolactone, but serum potassium levels were persistently fluctuating and the patient was hospitalised for further evaluation. During hospitalisation, repeated medical history and diagnostic examinations revealed licorice-induced AME complicated by excessive use of terbutaline and massive water intake. Licorice discontinuation, reduction of terbutaline and normalisation of water intake led to fully normalised potassium levels. Despite careful clinical history and diagnostic work-up, hospitalisation may be necessary in selected patients with long-term hypokalaemia.",

        "Abstract": "Groin pain is a common problem in athletes. The diagnosis can be difficult because of the complexity of the groin anatomy, the numerous clinical entities presenting with similar symptoms, the concurrence of those entities and the confusing terminology. Thus, a dilemma in diagnosis may arise leading to long-standing symptoms, disabling groin pain, mismanagement and therefore to poor treatment. Hereby, we present such a case of a recreational athlete complaining for excruciate pubic pain after being misdiagnosed and subsequently mistreated affecting her quality of life. We report on a new interesting finding, the focal osteopenia over the pubic parasymphyseal bone, together with administration of bisphosphonates for first time, as a treatment, for this condition in this body area. Our purpose is to shed light on the pathomechanism of groin pain labelled as osteitis pubis. We also outline the importance of thorough history and physical examination combined with appropriate advanced imaging.",

        "Abstract": "Stuttering occurs in approximately 5% of all children and 1% of adults. One type, neurogenic stuttering, is usually attributable to strokes or other structural damages to the brain areas that are responsible for language fluency. Here, we present the first case of neurogenic stuttering caused by a brain abscess. The patient was a 60-year-old man admitted for a seizure and administered an anticonvulsant, after which he began stuttering. MRI revealed a brain abscess in the left frontal lobe that extended to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA (Brodmann's area) 9 and 46), frontal eye field (BA 8) and premotor cortex and supplementary motor area (BA 6). After neurosurgical drainage and antibiotic treatment, the symptoms had resolved. This case is unique in that the therapeutic effects and localisation of the cause of stuttering were rapidly identified, allowing for a more accurate description of the neural circuitry related to stuttering.",

Head and neck lesions are uncommon with no early warning signs and presents with overt metastases at primary presentation in 25%-30% of reported cases. The incidence of haemangiomas that suggest malignancy are similar to that of bone metastasis. Calvarial haemangiomas usually present as asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on imaging or postmortem examination. We report a case where an initial diagnosis of benign tumour of the skull was made based on clinical presentation and calvarial haemangioma on CT head but was confirmed as metastatic clear cell carcinoma of the kidney after histopathological results. Skull metastases are rare and present late in the course of the disease. It is unusual for metastatic lesion to be the primary presentation in a clinically silent renal cell carcinoma.",

This report documents the rarely reported association between HLH and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) with simultaneous HIV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and complete resolution with chemotherapy. The patient initially presented with cholestatic jaundice. He was then found to have HL associated with HLH with coexistent HIV and EBV viraemia. A-Brentuximab-VD regimen for the lymphoma was initiated, resulting in rapid resolution of HLH and ultimately remission of HL. HLH is a syndrome known to have high mortality; thus, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial. Usual presentation includes non-specific symptoms and can easily be overlooked. This case highlights the importance of diagnosing the condition in unusual settings and attempting treatment by targeting the cause of HLH, HL in our case.",

The case demonstrates the rapid and nearly complete resolution of dramatic skin findings after a course of hydrocortisone ointment and oral antibiotics with adjuvant measures. For resettled refugees, access to family physicians and local language proficiency are common barriers that negatively impact their health and healthcare. We discuss some aspects of how the healthcare model in one Canadian city addresses these issues in the context of this case. The case also raises questions about the burden of dermatological conditions in refugees while in transit and in countries of resettlement. The few reports that exist suggest that some conditions may be relatively common and that the epidemiology warrants additional investigation.",

Examination revealed left mandibular hypoesthesia without any other sign or symptoms. Orthopantomogram was unremarkable apart from mild alveolar bone expansion at tooth 36 area, which was extracted 3 months earlier. Subsequently, a full-body positron emission tomography contrast enhanced computer tomography revealed hypermetabolic lesions of her axial (excluding skull) and appendicular skeleton. In the head and neck region, left mandibular foramen and oropharynx bilaterally showed increased metabolism suggestive of tumour metastasis. The diagnosis was numb chin syndrome secondary to mandibular metastasis. Apart from supportive treatment, she was started on palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Rare cases of idiopathic pneumoperitoneum have been described in the literature, the underlying causes and pathophysiology of which remain uncertain. We present a case of pneumoperitoneum in an extremely preterm infant with severe growth restriction. This occurred while she was receiving high frequency oscillatory ventilation. She had respiratory distress syndrome with pulmonary interstitial emphysema. The pneumoperitoneum occurred in isolation. Despite the insertion of two surgical drains and two exploratory laparotomies in which no obvious intestinal perforation was noted, the free air in the abdomen reaccumulated. A decision was made to manage it conservatively. She was successfully extubated on the fourth week of life and the pneumoperitoneum resolved spontaneously. She was discharged home on day 136 of life. This case highlights our limited understanding of the intricate physiology of extremely low birthweight preterm neonates.",

        "Abstract": "Foreign bodies in the rectum are commonly confronted worldwide in the surgical emergency. Such a situation arises either accidentally or for autoerotic purposes. A wide variety of foreign objects have been reported in the literature and this usual object would add to the reports for its unusual location. We report a case of a 26-year-old young man with accidental insertion of hand shower in the rectum and no signs of any active bleed or peritonism. Extraction was done successfully in the operating room under general anaesthesia, with an uneventful postprocedure period and the patient was discharged after 48 hours of observation. Rectal foreign bodies can be of wide variety and can lead to life-threatening conditions. An orderly approach is required for diagnosis, management and evaluation in the postprocedure period.",

            "#text": "Endometrial metastatic malignant melanoma is a rare occurrence from any primary site. A literature search has revealed only 15 reported cases in existing literature, majority of which originated from a primary cutaneous lesion. This is a case of endometrial metastasis of primary malignant melanoma of the brain, the first reported case of its kind. The rarity of endometrial metastatic melanoma may incline clinicians to neglect the importance of malignant melanoma in a patient's history when they present with abnormal uterine bleeding. However, with increasing rates of primary malignant melanoma, it is likely that the incidence of metastasis to rare sites, such as the endometrium, is also likely to increase. For those women with metastatic disease confined to the uterus, total abdominal hysterectomy +/-bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy improved prognosis considerably. Newer  molecular testing and targeted adjuvant therapy may also significantly improve prognosis in addition to surgical resection and should be considered."

We present a case of a 70-year-old man with multiple myeloma, which was systemically responding to chemotherapy, who developed testicular swelling, erythema and pain. Ultrasound findings were concerning for infection, although urine and serum testing were unremarkable. The patient did not improve after several rounds of antibiotics prompting further evaluation. The patient underwent radical orchiectomy which revealed testicular plasmacytoma. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) of the testicular tissue noted mutations which had not been present in the FISH analysis of bone marrow. Positron emission tomography scan later revealed new retroperitoneal plasmacytomas involving the new clone and his chemotherapy regimen needed to be adjusted for treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Aggressive angiomyxoma (AAM) is a rare mesenchymal myxoid tumour localised to the pelvis and/or perineum in adult females in reproductive age group. AAM is very rare in males, with <50 cases described in literature, and involves scrotum, spermatic cord and perineum. It is slow growing, with a marked tendency for local recurrence after excision, but without metastatic potential. We present a rare case of a paratesticular AAM in a man aged 53 years. Tumour cells were immunoreactive for desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), vimentin, CD34 and were negative for S100. Unlike AAMs in females which express oestrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) in >90% cases, the tumour cells in our case were negative for ER and PR, suggesting that the hypothesis that these markers play a role in tumour development and pathogenesis, does not apply in males. Androgen receptor positivity was noted in 2%-5% tumour cells.",

        "Abstract": "In patients with primary cutaneous melanomas of the distal upper limb, metastatic involvement of the epitrochlear lymph nodes is uncommon. It belongs to a particular category of nodal metastasis termed as interval or in-transit lymphadenopathies often encountered by tumour cells as they spread from the primary sites. We describe the case of a 41-year-old woman who presented with a right forearm melanoma that was metastatic to both the epitrochlear and axillary lymph nodes. She underwent wide excision of the primary lesion as well as epitrochlear and axillary nodal clearances in the same sitting. Although uncommon, It is prudent to search for the presence of sentinel lymph nodes in the epitrochlear region although uncommon, and where positive, a completion axillary clearance should be undertaken at the same time as the epitrochlear clearance. Failure to detect the presence of interval lymph nodes along the melanoma spread pathways may be a cause of tumour recurrence.",

        "Abstract": "Instability or recurrent dislocations are a common reason for revision of total hip replacements (THRs). Dual-mobility constructs can help improve stability by increasing the femoral head jump distance. These constructs are used to decrease the risk of re-revision in the setting of recurrent dislocation. This case describes an unusual case of irreducible dislocation of a re-revision THR due to intraprosthetic dislocation. The patient required open reduction and revision of this construct to a tripolar implant. This is important to appreciate from an emergency medicine point of view as repeated attempts at reduction will be fruitless and may result in a femur fracture. This particular type of dislocation is very rare. Perioperative considerations should include early referral to the orthopaedic team for reduction in theatre, and having a low threshold for open reduction. Revision options should be available when bringing a case like this to the operating theatre.",

She eventually presented with severe malnutrition and acute bowel obstruction, revealing a mass of the transverse colon. A well-differentiated Lieberkühn adenocarcinoma was established by histology. The patient underwent transverse and right colectomy and was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is predominantly a disease of older adults and is extremely rare in children and adolescents. Seldom suspected, it is more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage, with unfavourable tumour histology and poor outcome. Young patients diagnosed with CRC should receive genetic counselling regardless of their family history or tumour type. This reports' take-home message is that recurrent and persistent digestive symptoms in the young should alert physicians and lead to further investigations.",

        "Abstract": "A 35-year-old man presented after a high-speed motor vehicle accident and the driver's side curtain air bag causing blunt force trauma rupturing his right globe. The tangential force of the air bag resulted in an unusual arcuate horseshoe-shaped rupture through the lateral rectus insertion, causing avulsion of the muscle and tearing the sclera, with the apices of the tear extending anteriorly towards the limbus. Repair of the globe rupture was undertaken, and secondary vitrectomy revealed that the scleral tear had not involved the retina abutting the ora serrata. Silicone oil tamponade was used to fill the globe and the postoperative best corrected vision was 6/9. This is the first reported case of a ruptured globe caused by a side curtain air bag, resulting in a uniquely shaped arcuate scleral wound combined with lateral rectus avulsion, not associated with rhegmatogenous retinal damage, and is the first air bag-related globe rupture with scleral involvement to report a final best-corrected visual acuity better than 6/60.",

        "Abstract": "An adolescent patient diagnosed with disseminated abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumour (DSRCT) was taken up for systemic chemotherapy, debulking surgery, stem cell transplant followed by whole abdominopelvic radiotherapy using intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Following this, the patient developed multiple episodes of small bowel obstruction, a known complication of abdominal surgery and radiotherapy. The patient expired due to the complications of bowel obstruction 13 months after the completion of radiotherapy. Though we managed to achieve a complete response at the disease sites with an aggressive therapeutic approach, the patient eventually succumbed to treatment-induced morbidity. Large prospective trials to define management guidelines taking into account quality of life issues may not be feasible for a rare and aggressive scenario such as DSRCT. Therefore, case reports and series reporting not just the treatment techniques and survival, but also the resultant toxicities, will make us vigilant when choosing the intensity of its treatment.",

The clinical symptoms were subtle with fatigue and vague right upper quadrant tenderness. We ruled out drug-associated hepatotoxicity and screened for common causes of acute hepatitis. Interestingly, she was noted to have reactive anti-hepatitis E virus (HEV) IgM at initial presentation followed by anti-HEV IgG positivity a month later. The serological pattern confirmed the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E. The combination of antiviral therapy for hepatitis B and resolution of acute hepatitis E resulted in normalisation of serum aminotransferases.

Patients are unlikely to discuss tattoos with medical professionals, even though these might be relevant. Long-term immunosuppressed patients are often young adults who may wish to consider tattooing. It is well recognised that immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk of infection including cutaneous mycobacterial infections. They therefore represent a group that is at a potentially higher risk of tattoo-related complications and warrant special consideration.We present the first documented case of inflammatory myopathy as a complication following tattooing in an immunosuppressed individual. This unusual case presented as distal thigh and medial knee pain and it was only after some time that a link to the tattoo was made. This serves as a reminder to consider tattoo-related complications in the differential diagnosis of unusual atraumatic musculoskeletal pain, especially in immunosuppressed individuals.",

Such lesions reaching a size of more than 1 cm are termed as giant arachnoid granulations (GAGs) which have been previously reported to cause venous hypertension and headaches. We report a case of GAG involving the proximal half of the superior sagittal sinus in a 45-year-old male patient which was associated with left temporal thrombosed dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) whose thrombosed draining veins were seen converging towards the site of GAG. The patient presented with three episodes of generalised tonic-clonic seizures and improved with conservative treatment. No reports of such association of GAG with AVF is available in the literature, and we believe it could have occurred due to venous hypertension induced by GAG.",

        "Abstract": "Given the prevalence of breast cancer and the mortality associated with metastatic disease, it is imperative for physicians to not only be aware of common sites but also of rare metastatic destinations such as the bladder. A postmenopausal woman with a medical history of stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma, oestrogen receptor/progesterone receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative, in remission for 9 years, presented to her primary care physician with concerns of increased urinary urgency, frequency and incontinence. The patient underwent cystoscopy with biopsy of an area of granulation tissue. Biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma consistent with breast primary. The common sites of metastases from breast cancer are lung, bone and liver. This case is unique where breast cancer was found to metastasise to the bladder. It is important for physicians to consider further investigation when a breast cancer survivor develops urinary symptoms even without haematuria.",

        "Abstract": "Continuous duodenal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is an established treatment to control motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. Duodenal infusion allows a steady absorption of the drug in the small bowel, reducing plasmatic fluctuations of levodopa. Some complications may occur during the treatment, often related to intrajejunal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG-J). We report a case of duodenal ulcer associated with a phytobezoar involving the end of jejunal probe, in a patient who underwent PEG-J for LCIG infusion. In the last 2 weeks, the patient suffered from abdominal pain and dyspepsia. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy showed an ulcerative lesion of the duodenum due to traction of the jejunal tube; the end of the jejunal tube was wrapped in a phytobezoar. This case is interesting because of the extension of the ulcerative lesion due to PEG-J dislocation and because of the subtle symptoms associated with it.",

This case contributes to a growing body of literature contending that unexplained streptococcal bacteraemia merits a thorough workup that may include relatively invasive procedures such as endoscopy. Diagnostic colonoscopy provides an opportunity to prevent invasive malignancy that may outweigh bleeding and perforation risks in elderly patients."

It can also be performed in countries where abortion is legally recognised but, for various reasons, may be undertaken in an illegal environment. We present a case of a possible illegal abortion. A woman presented to the hospital with a dead fetus, saying that she was the victim of a car accident. Forensic and gynaecological examination of the woman were carried out, along with an autopsy of the fetus. It was discovered that the woman had performed a clandestine abortion. The differential diagnosis between illegal abortion and miscarriage represents a complicated issue and requires both clinical and forensic support.

Consequently, its pathophysiology and disease progression remain poorly understood.A 63-year-old woman presented with a history of a swelling in her vagina. Two-dimensional pelvic floor ultrasound and MRI demonstrated a multiloculated cyst with no malignant features. Initial workup provided a working diagnosis of a suburethral cyst. The diagnosis of MA was made on histology after excision of the cyst. Subsequent postoperative investigation showed no spread of the disease. The patient completed a course of prophylactic brachytherapy to prevent the possibility of any recurrence of disease. Due to its rarity, it remains difficult to diagnose MA of the vagina even on histological analysis. We would therefore recommend a low threshold to excise or perform tissue biopsy of unspecified vaginal masses.",

        "Abstract": "A young female vaper presented with insidious onset cough, progressive dyspnoea on exertion, fever, night sweats and was in respiratory failure when admitted to hospital. Clinical examination was unremarkable. Haematological tests revealed only thrombocytopenia, which was long standing, and her biochemical and inflammatory markers were normal. Chest radiograph and high-resolution CT showed diffuse ground-glass infiltrates with reticulation. She was initially treated with empirical steroids and there was improvement in her oxygenation, which facilitated further tests. Since the bronchoscopy and high-volume lavage was unyielding, a video-assisted thoracoscopicsurgical biopsy was done later and was suggestive of lipoid pneumonia. The only source of lipid was the vegetable glycerine found in e-cigarette (EC). Despite our advice to quit vaping, she continued to use EC with different flavours and there is not much improvement in her clinical and spirometric parameters.",

        "Abstract": "The majority of natal and neonatal teeth are prematurely erupted primary teeth, whereas few are supernumerary in origin. They most commonly occur in mandibular central incisor region and often can lead to difficulty to the mother during breast feeding and tongue ulceration in newborn. Moreover, since majority of these have poorly developed roots and are mobile, there is always a fear of aspiration into respiratory passage. Extraction therefore is the most commonly rendered treatment for these teeth. This paper comprises cases of natal and neonatal teeth describing about their clinical characteristics and sequel. This paper has also highlighted the factor which needs to be considered during the management of natal/neonatal teeth and protocol followed at our centre.",

        "Abstract": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked disorder, described as a clinical triad of microthrombocytopenia, eczema and recurrent infections. Different mutations in WAS gene have been identified, resulting in various phenotypes and a broad range of disease severity, ranging from classic WAS to X-linked thrombocytopenia and X-linked neutropenia. WAS in some cases can be fatal without haematopoietic stem cell transplantation early in life. In this particular case, we present a novel mutation with a unique presentation. An 18-year-old man incidentally found to have macrothrombocytopenia and neutropenia at 16 years of age later found to be hemizygous for c. 869T>C (p.Ile290Thr) mutation in WAS gene. The late presentation, absence of other manifestations of WAS and presence of macrothrombocytopenia, rather than microthrombocytopenia, which is usually a characteristic finding in WAS, misled the initial diagnosis. On review of literature, this mutation has not been reported as causing WAS.",

Pneumatosis intestinalis is a rare complication of systemic sclerosis; management approaches focus largely on exclusion of life-threatening surgical pathologies and subsequent symptom control. To date, there are still no established gold-standard treatment strategy and no large-scale trial data to support a specific management strategy. We describe a case of successful medical management with a combination of antimicrobial, elemental diet and high-flow inhalation oxygen therapy, with supporting evidence of CT image confirming resolution. This case therefore contributes to the literature, being the first to report both symptomatic and radiological improvement following combination therapy without the need for surgical intervention.",

The authors encountered a very rare case of severe HSV pneumonia in an immunocompetent host. The patient was an 85-year-old Japanese woman who presented with severe intractable pneumonia refractory to empirical antimicrobial therapy. Furthermore, the causative microorganisms remained unknown. Therefore, cytological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and protected brush biopsy of the lower respiratory tract were performed, which indicated herpes virus-infected cells with nuclear inclusions; PCR assay was positive for HSV DNA. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with HSV pneumonia. Her respiratory condition improved immediately after initiation of acyclovir monotherapy. In selected cases of intractable pneumonia refractory to standard antimicrobial therapy, the possibility of HSV pneumonia should be pursued.",

A focused assessment with sonography for trauma scan showed free fluid in the hepatorenal recess and in the recto-uterine recess. Later, due to clinical deterioration and the differential possibility of a pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection, a CT scan was performed which revealed large pericardial effusion. This, together with a dilated vena cava inferior and portal system, raised the suspicion of cardiac tamponade. The diagnosis was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). In retrospect, the ECG at admission showed a sinus tachycardia, low-voltage QRS complexes and a total electrical alternans corresponding with the swinging heart seen on TTE. An electrical alternans on ECG is an important diagnostic clue but is often missed, causing an unnecessary delay to proper diagnostic and therapeutic measures.",

        "Abstract": "We report a case of acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to a small intestine polypoid arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in a patient with a remote history of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) 8 years earlier. The diagnosis of a small intestine AVM was made using video capsule endoscopy (VCE) and confirmed using single-balloon push enteroscopy. The lesion was marked with submucosal tattoo to aid in subsequent surgical resection of the lesion with primary duodenoduodenostomy. Since our patient's initial bleeding episode, a variety of advanced tools have become widely available to aid in the localisation of OGIB. This case illustrates the use of a stepwise approach using new medical technology to identify and manage OGIB in children. VCE and push enteroscopy proved to be important diagnostic modalities in this paediatric case.",

        "Abstract": "Primary blepharospasm is an adult-onset focal dystonia characterised by involuntary contractions of the orbicularis oculi, leading to bilateral spasmodic closure of the eyelids. While spasms of this muscle constitute the hallmark of disease, other motor manifestations include increased spontaneous blinking and apraxia of eyelid opening. Originally misdiagnosed as a psychiatric condition, blepharospasm is now well established as being of neurological origin although questions remain as to its pathophysiological mechanisms.We report a 66-year-old woman who had a 14-year history of primary blepharospasm which completely resolved following a left medial cerebral artery thromboembolic infarct of the lenticular nucleus. This report provides supporting evidence of the lenticular nucleus as a key structure mediating the disease which can lead to functional blindness.",

        "Abstract": "Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a rare systemic disease, often unrecognised in the primary care setting. POEMS syndrome is associated with plasma cell dyscrasias and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor leading to systemic oedema, papilloedema and pulmonary hypertension. A wide constellation of presenting symptoms often leads to late diagnosis. Unrecognised and untreated disease rapidly leads to death from neuropathic exhaustion or cardiopulmonary failure. Treatment is extrapolated from other plasma cell dyscrasias such as multiple myeloma. Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is often an important component of treatment. There is no established standard of care for POEMS syndrome. Therapies include lenalidomide, bortezomib and targeted monoclonal antibodies. We present a patient with POEMS syndrome who achieved rapid complete response to triple therapy consisting of lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide and prednisone, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and PBSCT.",

Despite being a relatively low risk surgery, the overall complication rates range between 1.6% and 3%. Common complications include postoperative haemorrhage, haematoma formation, wound infection, wound dehiscence and flap/graft necrosis. Osteomyelitis after dermatological cancer surgery is exceedingly rare. There have only been two cases of osteomyelitis in association with Mohs surgery reported in the literature to date. Here, we describe an epidemiologically atypical patient who initially presented with fever and altered mental status and later found to have calvarial osteomyelitis, intracranial abscess (empyema) and meningoencephalitis as a result of Mohs surgery. Although rare, it is a predictable side effect postsurgery, and prevention of such complications are critical to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing MMS.",

Cardiac T wave memory is a benign, under-recognised and clinically important phenomenon seen after periods of altered ventricular conduction. After normal ventricular conduction is restored, the T wave 'remembers' and mirrors the direction of the wide QRS complex. Therefore, negative T waves are seen in leads that had negative wide QRS complexes. We describe the case of a 60-year-old truck driver with chest pain, deep TWI and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. After ruling out significant myocardial ischaemia, it was crucial to determine the cause of his T wave changes to provide reassurance and provide commercial license medical clearance. While it is currently a diagnosis of exclusion, it remains an important clinical entity for clinicians to recognise to provide an explanation for certain T wave changes to avoid future unnecessary cardiac testing.",

Spontaneous bleeding ensued from both ears towards the end of the procedure. Patient remained haemodynamically stable. The procedure was aborted and otolaryngology consult sought. Otoscopy showed bilateral haematoma from anterior ear canal with normal tympanic membranes and no hearing loss. Nasendoscopy revealed erythematous ostium of both Eustachian tubes. Bleeding stopped spontaneously and patient required no further imaging or treatment.

        "Abstract": "Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) are rare malignant neoplasms of exocrine glands, most commonly found in salivary glands. This report describes a 67-year-old woman with metastatic ACC to the breast, only the third reported case of its kind. The salivary gland ACC was first diagnosed 5 years prior. Routine mammogram identified a Breast Imaging and Reporting Systems (BIRADS) 4 lesion. Core breast biopsy demonstrated findings consistent with metastatic ACC to the breast. The patient ultimately underwent local excision but suffered a recurrence of disease less than 2 months later despite chemotherapy. She passed away 15 months after excision due to complications associated with a small bowel obstruction and decompensated respiratory status from pulmonary metastases. While metastatic salivary ACC to the breast is rare, it is important to be able to distinguish metastatic salivary ACC to the breast from primary ACC of the breast as the treatment considerations for the two disease processes differ significantly.",

Valsalva-like activities such as coughing have been identified as potential triggers for the development of SCAD.

Adequate haematological treatment and prophylaxis helps in preventing these haematomas. Currently, there is no uniform standard management protocol for this entity due to rarity of these lesions. PTH are seen in 1%-2% of the severe haemophilic patients. They may also be seen in moderate cases when adequate factor coverage is not provided or in cases with factor VIII inhibitors. We report a rare case of mandibular pseudotumour in a patient with moderate haemophilia and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, treated successfully with decompression of the haematoma. Postdecompression, sequential radiography revealed spontaneous bone regeneration at the site of the lesion. With 2 years follow-up, the mandible had no residual lesion. This reveals the role and potential of conservative decompression even in cases with severe osteodestruction secondary to developing haematoma of the mandible in haemophilic patients.",

Insertion and correct positioning of nasogastric tubes (NGT) proved to be difficult repeatedly in both cases over the course of a number of days. Repeated imaging found NGT tips sited in varied, atypical positions including extension into the hemithoraces. Delineation of repeated malpositioned NGTs identified oesophageal perforations in the case of both patients, one with fistulation into the right pleura and the other into the left pleura. Both patients developed an empyema ipsilateral to the side of fistulation. Both patients died, with subsequent postmortems concluding one patient to have experienced a spontaneous out-of-hospital oesophageal perforation, and the second patient's perforation developing as a consequence of a distal oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These two cases highlight the importance of questioning the possibility of underlying oesophageal pathology promptly if repeated NGT insertions are unsuccessful or imaging reveals unusual transit paths of NGTs.",

On the 14th month of treatment, he relapsed with central nervous system involvement characterised by leukaemic infiltration of the optic nerve and facial palsy. He subsequently underwent reinduction chemotherapy with aggressive intrathecal chemotherapy followed by posterior globe and whole brain radiation therapy. He is currently on his 26th month of treatment, in second remission, with complete resolution of leukaemic infiltrative optic neuropathy and facial paralysis.

        "Abstract": "We herein present a 51-year-old single female inpatient with treatment-resistant recurrent depressive disorder. Her most recent depressive episode has been severe and followed a chronic course, lasting for longer than 2 years. During the exacerbation of the patient's suicidal thoughts and plans, we repeatedly and independently observed vegetative and behavioural changes of the therapy-accompanying dog of the patient. Our findings suggest a role for dog-assisted therapy for augmenting treatment as well as for enhancing and developing novel adjunctive strategies for risk assessment in patients with chronic depression and suicidality. Possible social-biological mechanisms and underpinnings are discussed, by drawing on the available literature and comparative psychology. Collaboration with animal behaviourists and animal welfare scientists, in order to improve behavioural and physiological data interpretation and humaneness of dog-assisted therapy, is emphasised as a crucial component of future research.",

        "Abstract": "Haematuria in paediatric population is common yet alarming. It warrants a thorough physical examination and other investigations. Of late, a number of extremely rare aetiology of childhood haematuria have come to forefront. One such uncommon cause is benign fibroepithelial urinary bladder polyp. The presentation is of a child with intermittent haematuria exacerbated by physical/sports activity associated with or without suprapubic pain. Diagnosis is usually made by ultrasonography and cystoscopy and confirmed by histopathological examination. Treatment is surgical and involves cystoscopic transurethral resection of the mass. The exact aetiology of benign fibroepithelial polyp is uncertain with no clear guidelines on long-term surveillance. However, these cases should be subjected to cystourethroscopy if haematuria recurs. Treatment is surgical with good long-term prognosis. Not much is written in literature about benign fibroepithelial bladder polyp.",

        "Abstract": "An African American teenage boy during an acute sickle cell crisis spontaneously developed acute bifrontal epidural haematomas (EDHs) in addition to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The successfully evacuated EDH reaccumulated postoperatively. After multiple transfusions, the patient underwent repeat surgery. Subsequent maximal medical therapy was unable to significantly improve the patient's neurological status, and due to family wishes, care was withdrawn. EDH are the most common emergent neurosurgical complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Twenty-two such cases have been previously reported. We present one further complicated by DIC leading to reaccumulation of the patient's EDH. An understanding of the mechanisms of EDH formation in SCD and their associated radiological findings could help clinicians identify when a patient is at high risk of EDH formation and thus offer the potential for early intervention prior to the development of an emergency.",

        "Abstract": "Recreational drug use is a significant societal issue and remains a clinical challenge in emergency and critical care departments. We report on a 19-year-old woman admitted to hospital semiconscious and with severe hyponatraemia. Urinalysis was positive for methamphetamine and supported a diagnosis of hyponatraemia related to ecstasy use together with a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The woman was transferred to an intensive care unit, where a hypertonic saline infusion was started. Three hours postadmission she developed polyuria. Follow-up urinalysis at this point was consistent with water intoxication. This case is a reminder that hyponatraemia is a potentially fatal complication after the ingestion of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, illustrates the sequential nature of an SIADH and water intoxication and highlights the importance of considering the sequence of onset of hyponatraemia, as the patient may be admitted at any stage.",

The patient presented with upper abdominal wall ecchymosis, pain and vomiting. He was discharged after 24 hours with resolving symptoms. However, the boy presented 2 days later febrile with signs of peritonitis. CT indicated duodenal perforation, which was confirmed during laparotomy where common bile duct rupture was also demonstrated. Primary repair of the duodenum was undertaken. Here, decompression was achieved with a nasogastric tube proximal to the injury and T-tube duodenostomy distally. Common bile duct repair was achieved over a biliary stent. This case represents a rare subset of duodenal injury for which there is a paucity of evidence for optimal surgical management, particularly in the paediatric setting. This operative plan will guide surgeons and junior doctors in managing complicated cases like this in future.",

The facial palsy resolved with steroid treatment; however, the hearing loss is irreversible, which has had a profound impact on his life and career.

The patient underwent surgery to resect the thoracic-level mass. The tumour adhered strongly to the neural tissue and could only be partially resected. On pathological examination, the resected tumour was diagnosed as a mature teratoma. The tumour regrew and disseminated within 3 months after resection. Both the spinal cord tumour and the tumour in the pineal region shrank significantly after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although the tumour was pathologically diagnosed as a mature teratoma, we suspect that the residual tumour contained an immature or malignant component. Thus, careful follow-up observation is mandatory after partial resection of a mature teratoma. In addition, because teratomas can disseminate in the central nervous system, the presence of teratoma should prompt an examination of both the spinal cord and brain.",

We describe an unusual presentation of a gossypiboma presenting in a 32-year-old man with acute epigastric pain and haematemesis. His surgical history revealed an emergency laparotomy following a road traffic accident 16 years ago. Initial gastroscopy showed extrinsic stomach compression. An abdominal ultrasound scan followed by a CT scan evidenced a large, well-defined, predominantly cystic mass with some solid areas occupying the left hypochondrium. Conservative management with insertion of a percutaneous drain proved to be inefficient. A laparotomy was performed; intraoperatively, the cyst was found to be ruptured and within it, a large surgical gauze was found. This was removed but required a distal pancreatectomy and gastrectomy for complete excision. He was discharged on day 74 of admission with outpatient follow-up.",

Tumour recurrence is very common, and the benefits of adjuvant therapy are undefined. A 39-year-old woman presented with 6 months' history of abdominal pain, abdominal distension and pedal oedema. On evaluation, she was diagnosed to have chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) secondary to a tumour arising from the inferior vena cava (IVC) on evaluation. Her liver decompensation included jaundice, gastrointestinal bleed and ascites. Following a detailed multidisciplinary team discussion, she underwent complete excision of the tumour along with a segment of the IVC with living donor liver transplantation. She remains disease-free 24 months following surgery. This is the first reported case of liver transplantation for IVC LMS causing chronic BCS.",

Located in the right internal jugular vein, the line had previously been working normally with the change occurring shortly after the patient was liberated from positive pressure mechanical ventilation. An arterial malposition was ruled out and subsequent investigations revealed the presence of a left-sided partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) that had been previously undiagnosed. The identification of a left-sided PAPVC from blood gas measurements taken from a right internal jugular vein dialysis catheter in this case provides an informative opportunity to consider the intricate physiological relationship between the respiratory and cardiovascular systems in critically ill patients requiring invasive procedures and treatments.",

Many people believe that smoking an e-cigarette (vaping) does not have any side effects, especially among teenagers and young adults. Teenagers using an e-cigarette at a young age are twice as likely to try cigarettes later in their life because of nicotine dependency or other social factors. More recent studies have shown long-term systemic side effects of vaping regardless of traditional cigarette smoking history. This report was done for further assessing their risk and to clear out misconceptions of this large-scale condition.",

After the history was obtained, patient admitted heroin use earlier that day. The initial physical examination revealed right eye ptosis, diplopia, fatigability of neck flexion and extension. She also presented with wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. Pupils were 4 mm, with sluggish response to light bilaterally. CT chest with contrast showed a large mediastinal mass. Three different processes coexisted in this patient: simultaneous occurrence of a myasthenia gravis crisis, asthma exacerbation and a component of heroin use. This case highlights a series of overlapping clinical features that could lead to potential confounding and misdiagnosis. Respiratory symptoms improved after initial treatment for asthma exacerbation, but ptosis, diplopia and fatigability of neck muscles persisted.",

She was otherwise in good health with only a recent diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis that preceded her presenting symptoms. Her initial laboratory evaluation was consistent with Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) but was otherwise unremarkable. MRI of the spine revealed bilateral diffuse nerve root enhancement from at least C6 to the conus level, suggesting an inflammatory process. Lumbar puncture demonstrated high protein (629 mg/dL) with marked pleocytosis (363 cells/mcL) incompatible with albuminocytological dissociation typically seen in Guillain-Barre syndrome. A thorough diagnostic evaluation was undertaken to explore potential infectious, malignant and autoimmune conditions. Lyme disease serology (ELISA and Western Blot, IgM and IgG) was positive leading to a final diagnosis of lymphocytic meningoradiculitis or Bannwarth syndrome.",

Multimodality imaging is extremely important for diagnosis and tissue characterisation of all cardiac masses. Despite treatment, pericardial sarcomas are considered extremely fatal. We encountered a 27-year-old female patient who presented to our facility with progressive dyspnoea. On examination, clinical signs of cardiac tamponade were appreciated, transthoracic echocardiography revealed a tamponading pericardial effusion and a large heterogeneous pericardial mass. Pericardiocentesis revealed haemorrhagic fluid. Subsequently, CT revealed a pericardial mass compressing the right atrium. Excision biopsy showed a well-circumscribed mass, and cut sections showed friable grey-white tissue with areas of haemorrhage and necrosis. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of high-grade undifferentiated sarcoma of the pericardium. The patient was started on adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

        "Abstract": "Lymphangiomas are most commonly described as a small painless mass in the neck or a vesicular rash in an infant patient. Ninety per cent of cases are diagnosed before the age of 2. Treatment usually involves surgical resection. Intra-abdominal lymphangiomas and mesenteric lymphangiomas, as described in our case report, represent a rare pathology. The exact prevalence of this condition is unclear but it has been suggested in the literature that there have been as few as 820 cases since the 16th century. The clinical presentation is usually subacute and diagnosis made incidentally during a workup of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Acute abdominal symptoms, as in our case presentation, are unusual but may be explained by the mass effect of a large intra-abdominal lesion. Cross-sectional imaging is key in preoperative workup and operative planning. Complete surgical resection is recommended and curative in the majority of cases with a low risk of local recurrence.",

        "Abstract": "A 53-year-old man with a 1-year history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) presented with a left bicep mass. Biopsy and staging workup revealed Richter's transformation (RT) Ann Arbor stage 1E diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the bicep. The patient was treated with combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, Vincristine and prednisone followed by site radiation and did well thereafter. His CLL progressed and required treatment on two more occasions 11 and 18 years after his initial diagnosis with fludarabine, Cytoxan and Rituxan and then with bendamustine and rituximab. 23 years after initial presentation, he developed diffuse lymphadenopathy and B-symptoms. A biopsy of an enlarged cervical lymph node demonstrated only CLL for which he was started on ibrutinib. Treatment was shortly discontinued thereafter due to intolerance and worsening symptoms. A second biopsy was performed which revealed concurrent CLL and Hodgkin's lymphoma representing a second and histologically distinct RT.",

        "Abstract": "Kienböck's disease is a rare condition characterised by avascular necrosis of the lunate bone. Its natural history and aetiopathogenesis have not yet been clarified, nor are its triggering factors identified. We present a case of a 17-year-old male gymnast, without relevant medical/family history, with stage IIIA Kienböck's disease diagnosed in 2016. Initially, submitted to conservative treatment that proved to be insufficient. Consequently, surgical treatment was proposed, but refused. The patient instead underwent experimental treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (120 sessions, 100% oxygen at 2.5 atm, for 70 min periods, once daily, five times per week). In April 2018, a favourable clinical and radiological evolution was observed, with an improvement in the patterns of pain, motion and strength and an almost complete involution of the process of aseptic necrosis of the semilunar. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Kienböck's disease treated with hyperbaric oxygen.",

        "Abstract": "The flow-volume loop (FVL) analysis is typically helpful in establishing the diagnosis of airway obstruction caused by endobronchial lesions. In this report, we describe a patient with emphysema and tobacco abuse who presented with chronic dry cough and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refractory to standard therapy. The initial FVL showed a relatively normal forced expiratory peak flow shape followed by a smooth flattening of the expiratory curve on spirometry, a pattern consistent with distal airway obstruction as seen in severe asthma or COPD. The patient was later found to have a large endotracheal mass. This atypical presentation, along with the unusual FVL, led to a significant delay in the diagnosis of the tracheal mass. A high level of suspicion is needed to diagnose variable intrathoracic airway obstruction in patients presenting with severe asthma or COPD who fail to improve with standard therapy.",

This group represents a disenfranchised minority with adverse experiences and unique comorbidities that faces significant obstacles to receiving healthcare, including fear of deportation, language barriers, financial barriers and difficulty navigating an inconsistent and fragmented system. Healthcare is therefore often sought once symptoms have become critical, which can lead to more severe disease processes and multiple new diagnoses at presentation even in previously healthy patients. Here we present the case of a previously healthy 32-year-old undocumented immigrant who presented to a South Florida hospital with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and leg pain. He was diagnosed with both diabetes mellitus and chronic myelogenous leukaemia after a prolonged 20-day hospital stay. Culturally sensitive providers and dedicated staff play a major role in connecting patients to outpatient care after an acute illness, which most often occurs at charity clinics.",

This procedure was complicated by a parapharyngeal abscess and cellulitis. She was treated unsuccessfully with various courses of antibiotics, but briefly responded to short courses of steroids. As her cervical lymphadenopathy returned, she underwent an excisional lymph node biopsy, which demonstrated caseating granulomatous lymphadenitis. Extensive review of systems, physical examination, laboratory and imaging studies demonstrated no evidence of malignancy, infection or systemic lupus erythematosus .

Because bradycardia was detected on physical examination, ECG was performed which revealed the complete atrioventricular (AV) block. We stopped Ca-blocker and β-blocker, but the bradycardia persisted. He was admitted to our hospital for an emergent pacemaker implantation. On admission, he complained dyspnoea. After the surgery, he died due to deterioration of heart failure. The autopsy revealed cardiac metastasis of HCC on AV node, so it was suspected that cardiac metastasis caused the AV block. We thought that the cause of his death was the exacerbation of heart failure associated with bradycardia. It was likely that complete AV block as a very rare complication caused by cardiac metastasis of HCC influenced the prognosis of this patient.",

        "Abstract": "A 35-year-old Jehovah's Witness patient with total placenta previa was referred to our hospital at 30 weeks of gestation. She refused autologous and allogeneic blood transfusions, but agreed to receive acute normovolaemic haemodilution, intraoperative blood salvage and biological products. At 35 weeks, she underwent emergent caesarean delivery because of labour pains. Multidisciplinary therapy, including the insertion of balloon catheters into the bilateral common iliac arteries, acute normovolaemic haemodilution and intraoperative blood salvage, avoided hysterectomy; however, blood loss included amniotic fluid which was estimated to be 1910 mL. These treatments may be effective for total placenta previa in blood-refusal patients.",

        "Abstract": "Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare malignancy, presenting sporadically or as part of a genetic syndrome. Diagnosis of PC includes the histopathological diagnosis based on capsular, perineural, or vascular invasion or metastasis. High suspicion for malignancy includes hypercalcaemia greater than 14 mg/dL, extremely high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, as well as large masses. Given the rarity of PC, it is challenging to design clinical trials for newer therapy. Currently, complete initial surgical excision of the tumour in high-risk patients offers the best chance of cure and prolonged disease-free survival in PC. In the absence of definite data, non-surgical therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy are not routinely recommended. For early detection of recurrence; long-term clinical follow-up with interval measurements of serum calcium and PTH is recommended. Localising studies of PC are helpful. Early screening for CDC73 mutation and multidisciplinary treatment by an endocrine/ENT/surgical oncology team is recommended.",

However, delayed seroconversion of HCV antibodies and non-specific symptoms may hinder the diagnosis of this disease. A 71-year-old woman developed acute hepatitis while hospitalised for back pain. An HCV antibody test was negative, and she had no risk factors for hepatitis C. She was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. The HCV antibody test was repeated 16 days after the initial test; owing to a positive result, she was diagnosed with acute hepatitis C. Several months thereafter, the HCV spontaneously cleared. When diagnosing an HCV infection, the time at which the testing is performed needs to coincide with the time at which HCV antibody seroconversion occurs. Timely diagnosis of an HCV infection allows appropriate treatment during the acute phase which may prevent disease progression to the chronic phase.",

She was diagnosed with severe acute mountain sickness. Intramuscular dexamethasone was administered. Paracetamol (acetaminophen in the USA and Canada) and ondansetron were given as supportive management for headache and nausea. Arrangements were made to have her carried down by a porter immediately. After the descent, all her symptoms resolved. High-altitude pilgrims are a more vulnerable group than trekkers and mountaineers. Pilgrims generally have a rapid ascent profile, have low awareness of altitude illness and are strongly motivated to gain religious merit by completing the pilgrimage. As a result, there is a high incidence of altitude illness among pilgrims travelling to high-altitude pilgrimage sites.",

        "Abstract": "A premature twin infant girl was transferred to a level IV neonatal intensive care unit for recurrent bloody stools, anaemia and discomfort with feeds; without radiographic evidence of necrotising enterocolitis. Additional imaging after transfer revealed a large retroperitoneal mass in the region of the pancreas compressing the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta, raising suspicion for neuroblastoma. Abdominal exploration and biopsy unexpectedly revealed that the lesion was an infantile capillary haemangioma involving the small bowel, omentum, mesentery and pancreas. The infant was subsequently treated with propranolol, with a decrease in the size of the lesion over the first year of her life and a drastic improvement in feeding tolerance. While cutaneous infantile haemangiomas are common, visceral infantile haemangiomas are less so and may present a significant diagnostic challenge for clinicians. This interesting case demonstrates that such lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis for unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal symptoms in newborns.",

Coronary CT angiography showed a calcium score of 0 together with the absence of atherosclerotic plaques and normal origin and course of the coronary arteries. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography revealed an infracentimetric round-shaped mobile mass attached to a secondary tendinous chord of the anterior mitral valve leaflet. Cardiac magnetic resonance further evidenced localised contrast uptake supporting vascular irrigation, making thrombus unlikely. After surgical excision, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Histopathology disclosed the typical collagenous matrix covered by a single cell layer. Although mostly benign, cardiac tumours are prone to embolisation and can thus mimic an acute coronary syndrome. Multimodality imaging has an important role in unmasking the true mechanism, revealing less common aetiologies and elucidating the possibility of curative surgical resection.",

        "Abstract": "Neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal complication of sudden withdrawal of dopaminergic drugs. Clinical features are similar to that of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) like hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction, altered sensorium, muscle rigidity; but instead of history of neuroleptic use, there is history of withdrawal of dopaminergic drugs. Laboratory examination generally show elevated creatine phosphokinase levels and may show elevated total leucocyte count. Thrombocytopaenia has been very rarely reported with NMS but it has not been reported with NM-like syndrome. Here, we discuss a case of Parkinson's disease which presented with typical clinical features and risk factors of NM-like syndrome associated with thrombocytopaenia and type 1 respiratory failure. He was treated with bromocriptine and supportive care. Thrombocytopaenia and respiratory failure resolved with above treatment. The patient improved clinically and was successfully discharged on day 12 of admission.",

MRI showed white matter lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS), but no optic nerve enhancement. Eight months later, the left eye was affected in the same manner. Examination showed right optic atrophy and apparent left optic disc swelling. Workup revealed positive Lyme IgG. Differential diagnosis included optic neuritis and Lyme optic neuropathy, and he was treated with intravenous steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis and intravenous ceftriaxone without improvement. Neuro-ophthalmology consultation led to identification of pseudo-optic disc oedema, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) was suspected and confirmed by genetic testing. LHON may occur in association with MS, and should be considered in patients with MS with vision loss atypical for optic neuritis. This is especially important as new treatments for LHON (including gene therapy) are currently undergoing clinical trials.",

We present a case of a 19-year-old young woman with rupture of the common bile duct due to blunt trauma. She arrived at our hospital 1 hour after a car accident. She was diagnosed as pancreatic head injury, and conservative therapy was administered. It was effective, but after starting oral intake 6 days after the injury, she presented with abdominal fullness because of increased ascites. The ascites contained large amounts of bile. Rupture of the common bile duct became apparent, thus, she underwent emergency surgery 13 days after the injury. The common bile duct was ruptured completely at the lower bile duct. We repaired it by choledochojejunostomy. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she discharged on the 12 days after the surgery. Preoperative drip-infusion-cholangiography-CT was useful for its diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Less than 10% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are familial. Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) mutations are the most frequent aetiology and may be associated to atypical neurological manifestations. We report the case of a 27-year-old right-handed man, ensuing with mild cognitive impairment, motor discoordination and axial myoclonus after a parachute accident. At age 32 he was referred to our neurology clinic, presenting cognitive impairment, cerebellar syndrome, axial myoclonus and hypomimia, without other signs of parkinsonism. Because of absence of family history, he was worked up along the line of spinal ataxic disorders. Later, he developed pseudobulbar affect, cognitive deterioration, right upper limb paresis and spastic paraparesis. Subsequent investigation identified a PSEN1 P117L mutation and the diagnosis of autosomal dominant AD was made. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenge imposed by atypical presentation of de novo PSEN1 mutation, leading to unnecessary investigation. Genetic study might be essential for defining the diagnosis.",

An 84- year-old man was admitted to the outpatient clinic with haemoptysis, cough and dyspnoea. A CT scan showed an intraluminal, non-occluding tumour close to the right side of the main carina. A stent was inserted in the right main bronchus. The patient was, 7 months later, admitted to the emergency room with severe cough and dyspnoea. The stent was produced during a coughing spell. Retrospective investigation of available imaging revealed that the stent had been dislodged to a nearly 'perfect' position in the left main bronchus several months earlier which, however, had not been noticed and thus not reported by the radiologist describing the CT. The possibility of a right-left confusion should always be kept in mind, especially if a patient presents with renewed symptoms that should have been managed successfully.",

        "Abstract": "Hyperthyroidism is a common metabolic disorder, although its presentation as an endocrine emergency called thyroid storm is rare. Here we review a case of a thyroid storm as the initial presentation of thyrotoxicosis, with multiple organ failure and haemodynamic collapse due to low-output cardiac dysfunction. Quick intervention with aggressive antithyroid therapy, including steroid pulse, and supportive intensive care measures led to an outstanding improvement and full recovery. The present case clearly shows the beneficial impact of initial clinical suspicion resulting in an early diagnosis and intensive therapy. Moreover, it supports the additional role of steroids to aggressive antithyroid strategy in order to control associated deleterious systemic inflammatory reactions.",

The patient was unresponsive to commands and unable to provide any history. In the ER he was given a provisional diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Vital signs on admission were stable. On physical examination, he exhibited grimacing, muscle rigidity and areflexia. Workup for CVA and infectious aetiology was unremarkable and the patient's urine toxicology screen was negative. History from the patient's family revealed that 4 days prior to presentation, the patient had discontinued his prescribed dose of alprazolam 1 mg four times per day. The patient was diagnosed with catatonia due to benzodiazepine withdrawal and had gradual return to baseline with administration of lorazepam 1 mg intravenous three times per day.",

In the advanced stages of cancer, tumour cells nourish on the peritoneal serous causing carcinomatosis and peritoneal function abnormalities with liquid build-up inside it. Ascites from peritoneal carcinomatosis is common in patients with ovarian cancer. An obese woman suffering from ovarian cancer was found dead in her home from secondary cardio-respiratory arrest due to Multiple Organ Failure (MOF). An autopsy was performed. The abdominal incision showed an ascitic fluid outflow about 20 litres in volume and a flood about one metre and half. An association between obesity and intraperitoneal fluid volume secondary to peritoneal carcinomatosis has been demonstrated. This finding could improve the prognosis of patients through actions aimed to reduce body weight.",

He was cared for at a nursing facility where the tube became dislodged and was replaced with similar size Foley catheter. Patient was brought to the hospital with dislodged feeding Foley but none was found at the bedside. Diagnostic workup revealed antegrade migration of the catheter into the small bowel. Push enteroscopy was unsuccessful in retrieving the catheter because it was too far distal. Patient was observed for a total of 7 days. Due to lack of progress with conservative measures, a colonoscopy was performed to extract the catheter, thus avoiding the need for more invasive surgical measures. If a Foley catheter is used as a gastrostomy tube, it should be replaced with a dedicated feeding tube as quickly as possible and should always be affixed to the skin to prevent antegrade migration and associated complications.",

In this case report, we present a young 22-year-old man who presented with characteristic Wellens' ECG changes in the setting of pulmonary embolism with right ventricular strain. T-wave inversion in right precordial leads is a well-recognised ECG manifestation of right ventricular strain; however, biphasic T waves in the setting of pulmonary embolism are rare. Pulmonary embolism was seen in our patient a week after starting risperidone. There is a reported association between antipsychotic drugs and increased risk of thromboembolism.

An 18-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with an obstructing caecal mass initially suspected to be malignant. Surgical resection was complicated by bowel perforation, histology and cultures confirmed basidiobolomycosis infection. The postoperative course was complicated by an enterocutaneous fistula, fungal intra-abdominal abscesses, liver and lung abscesses, formation of mycotic hepatic artery aneurysm and meningoencephalitis. The patient eventually expired due to sepsis despite aggressive treatment. Diagnosis and management of such rare cases are very challenging and require a multidisciplinary approach.

Non-pharmacological interventions are recommended as first-line treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms, instead of medications such as atypical antipsychotics which have significant side effects. Most systematic reviews of non-pharmacological interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia focus on patients in long-term care facilities and there are a limited number of research studies assessing the use of non-pharmacological interventions for patient's living at home. In this case report, we discuss an elderly man with dementia whose cognitive symptoms were accompanied by significant neuropsychiatric symptoms of suspicion, delusions, agitation and aggression. We describe how a programme of individualised, non-pharmacological interventions was associated with an improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms within 3 months.",

        "Abstract": "We present a case report of anomalous mitral arcade in a live born former recipient of twin-twin transfusion syndrome. At 33+0 week of gestation fetal ultrasound demonstrated that she had a large mitral insufficiency, decreased movement of the lateral cusp of the mitral valve and dilated left atrium. The twins were delivered by caesarean section at week 33+1 due to fetal distress. The former recipient twin developed decompensated heart failure during her first day of life and was transferred to a surgical paediatric heart centre. Her clinical condition rapidly deteriorated, and she died of congestive heart failure 3 days old. Prenatal signs of anomalous mitral arcade in a recipient of twin-twin transfusion syndrome should warrant preparation of a critically ill neonate, including parental counselling and in utero transfer to surgical paediatric heart centre. There is a surgical treatment option available for neonates, but the experience with this technique is still very limited with a high risk of morbidity and mortality.",

The patient had been diagnosed 2 years earlier with an MPN/MDS overlap syndrome, based on characteristic mutations in JAK2, IDH1 and SRSF2. During his current evaluation, he was noted to have new microcytosis, with a mean corpuscular volume of ~70 fL down from his baseline of ~90 fL. His laboratory workup showed normal iron studies, normal haemoglobin electrophoresis, and no evidence of haemoglobin H or mutations in his ATRX coding region. Without any identifiable cause of his new microcytosis, he was given a presumptive diagnosis of acquired thalassemia in the setting of his unusual MPN/MDS overlap syndrome.",

Using telemedicine to seek specialist dermatology advice abroad, she was diagnosed with and managed for suspected congenital lamellar ichthyosis. Poor early recognition and limited resources, for both acute and chronic care, created significant challenges to optimal management; these were overcome, in part, by adopting a common sense, back-to-basics approach to treatment and by empowering the parents to take ownership of their infant's daily skin and eye care. This case highlights key global health issues associated with managing chronic, often debilitating, paediatric dermatological conditions in a low-income setting; namely, poor access to important diagnostic tools and medications, lack of experience and expertise in the management of severe skin disease and its associated complications, absence of long-term community support, alternative health beliefs and risk of sociocultural stigma.",

His medications included midodrine (10 mg, three times per day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg, two times per day), but neither treatment afforded symptomatic relief. Autonomic testing was performed. Head-up tilt table testing revealed a supine BP of 112/68 mm Hg (heart rate, 74 beats per minute (bpm)) after 6 min, which dropped to 76/60 mm Hg (83 bpm) within 2 min of 80° head-up tilt. Findings from a heart rate with deep breathing test and a Valsalva test were consistent with autonomic dysfunction. The patient was diagnosed with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and treated with droxidopa (100 mg, two times per day; titrated to 100 mg, one time per day). After initiating treatment with droxidopa, the patient no longer reported losing consciousness on standing and experienced improvement in activities of daily living. These improvements were maintained through 1 year of follow-up.",

Seven and a half months later, an endomyocardial biopsy revealed a hypercellular, atypical lesion. Evaluation was negative for acute cellular rejection and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Histopathologic features and immunohistochemical stains were consistent with EMT. We subsequently identified four additional cases of EMT in patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation and received a similar immune suppression regimen.

The patient presented to the emergency department with acute bilious vomiting and epigastric pain after acute consumption of a meal and excessive quantities of water. The patient was diagnosed with SMA syndrome based on the findings of contrasted CT of the abdomen. In early puberty, boys have a significant increase in lean body mass and a concomitant loss of adipose tissues. These pubertal changes lead to a narrowing of the aortomesenteric space. The acute consumption of food and water caused a transient obstruction at the already-narrowed space, which resulted in the manifestation of SMA syndrome. This case demonstrates that pubertal growth spurt is a risk factor for SMA syndrome, and acute excessive ingestion can trigger SMA syndrome among those in puberty.",

        "Abstract": "Intracardiac microcavitations consist of airy microbubbles. They are typically found in patients with an intravascular line or device, mechanical heart valves or in decompression sickness. We report a case of a patient in mid-70s who was admitted due to weakness in both legs, left-thoracic pain and fever. Despite the lack of any of the risk factors mentioned above, spontaneous microcavitations were detected in the right sided cardiac cavities. After the detection of liver lesions suspicious for a metastatic disease, a colonoscopy was performed. An ulcerated colonic carcinoma at the ileocoecal valve was diagnosed and highly suspicious for being the entry port of the microcavitations. This unusual presentation of microcavitations together with a colonic neoplasia leads to hypotheses about the journey of the microbubbles from the ascending colon into the right heart. Gastrointestinal tumours are described as being the causes of microbubbles. Translocation of microbubbles through hepatopulmonary shunting are described in the context of locally applied particles of similar size during radioembolisation. A thorough aetiological workup is of importance since the underlying cause is potentially dangerous due to its own nature of disease and due the complications of the microcavitations such as paradoxical emboli or pulmonary sequelae.",

After performing a stent-assisted coil embolisation of brain aneurysm, the image datasets were processed with a metal artefact reduction software followed by the automated image fusion programmes. Two patients who underwent aneurysm coiling using a Neuroform stent were evaluated. The reconstructed 3D images showed a detailed structure of the stent struts and identified malappositions of the deployed stents. Case 1 showed good apposition on the outer curvature side of the carotid siphon, while the inner curvature side showed prominent malapposition. Case 2, with multiple aneurysms, showed good apposition on both outer and inner curvature sides, although inward prolapse of the struts was observed. This new imaging technique may help evaluate stent apposition after the endovascular aneurysm treatment.",

Her observations showed severe hypertension with proteinuria. On examination, she had left hemiparesis and was aphasic. Fetal monitoring was reassuring. Initial CT did not reveal any evidence of intracranial pathology. She was stabilised and delivered via emergency caesarean section. Subsequent MRI and CT showed an acute right-sided infarct involving the right middle cerebral artery territory, frontal and parietal regions, and increased mass effect. She was transferred to the nearest neurosurgical centre where she was conservatively managed and discharged home 3 weeks later for continuing rehabilitation. She achieved a good recovery.",

To our knowledge, this is the first report on a fully described clinical case by using the interview. A 29-year-old primiparous mother gave birth to a healthy girl, but visited our clinic because of depression at one month postnatally and received pharmacotherapy. Despite improvement of her depression, at around 7 months postnatally, she felt distressed by childcare. The Stafford Interview was conducted and it manifested evidences of anger and rejection to her infant: she screamed at her infant because of anger towards her infant, and had desire to escape from the baby care and then temporally transferred the care to her mother (grandmother of the baby). The evidence of maternal feelings by using the Stafford Interview is practically useful for treating mothers with bonding disorders.",

He adopted a strict whole-foods, plant-based diet, without calorie or portion restriction or mandated exercise, and rapidly reduced his insulin requirements by >50%, and subsequently saw improvements in weight, blood pressure and cholesterol. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) increased from 45 to 74 mL/min after 4.5 months on the diet and his microalbumin/creatinine ratio decreased from 414.3 to 26.8 mg/g. His phosphorus level returned to the normal range. For individuals with CKD, especially those with obesity, hypertension, or diabetes, a strict, ad libitum whole-food, plant-based diet may confer significant benefit, although one must consider potential limitations of a creatinine-based GFR equation in the face of significant weight loss.",

        "Abstract": "Naltrexone is used as an off-label treatment in low doses for several chronic immune-modulated disorders in many countries. Although only small-scale clinical trials have been performed, these suggest efficacy in several diseases including Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia and Gulf War Illness. Despite numerous internet reports of response to low-dose naltrexone (LDN), no clinical trials exist in people with chronic fatigue syndrome. This condition is characterised by chronic profound fatigue, postexertional malaise, pain and autonomic and neurocognitive disturbances. This series of three case reports compiled by people with long-term ill-health due to chronic fatigue syndrome shows the range of responses they observed when taking LDN, from life changing to a reduction in some symptoms only. Treatment doses ranged from 4 to 12 mg. Clinical trials may be warranted to explore the potential use of naltrexone in people with these debilitating illnesses which currently have no licensed treatments available.",

Recent reports have demonstrated that pulmonary haemorrhage is one of the fatal complications of severe leptospirosis. In this report, we present a case of leptospirosis manifested with severe pulmonary haemorrhagic syndrome successfully treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). A 39-year-old man who lives in Bangkok presented with fever, severe myalgia and haemoptysis. With rapid progression of acute respiratory failure in 6 hours, he was intubated and a litre of fresh blood was suctioned. Chest x-ray showed diffuse alveolar infiltrates compatible with ARDS, then mechanical ventilator with lung protective strategy was used. Diagnosis of leptospirosis with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage was made. Refractory hypoxaemia was not responsive to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); thus, VV-ECMO was initiated on the first day. Other treatments included plasmapheresis, intravenous pulse methylprednisolone and intravenous antibiotics. The outcome of treatment was successful, and this patient was discharged to home on day 14 after admission.",

        "Abstract": "Here we describe an atypical presentation of progressive dysphagia in a 72-year-old man leading to frequent regurgitations over the course of 30 years. Investigations revealed a foreign body ring surrounding the proximal stomach and dilation of the oesophagus proximal to the gastro-oesophageal junction. An Angelchik device was extracted; however, the patient's rapid deterioration prior to surgery, in addition to his severely dysfunctional oesophagus, required placement of a jejunostomy feeding tube. Device removal was complicated by prior abdominal surgery, necessitating a thoracic approach. This case offers guidance on the management of patients with Angelchik prostheses who develop similar complications, while drawing attention to the importance and difficulties of early, definitive diagnosis in oesophageal pathology such as achalasia and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.",

A 46-year-old female patient with medical history of bipolar disorder developed a severe headache during her father's funeral. The following day she was discovered to have bilateral hemiparesis, aphasia, encephalopathy and was brought emergently to the hospital. Neuroimaging revealed a 33 mL left fronto-parietal haematoma with subarachnoid blood near the vertex bilaterally. She underwent craniotomy, haematoma evacuation and external ventricular drain placement. The patient received two cerebral angiograms, the first showing multifocal cerebral vasoconstriction and the second showing resolution of these changes. She improved significantly over the course of her 3-week hospitalisation and eventually made a full recovery, including the ability to speak fluently in six languages with no significant deficits other than hypersomnia; she now requires 10 hours of sleep each night as compared with 7 hours prior to her brain injury.",

Furthermore, and because in earlier studies some patients had evidenced mental retardation, such abnormality is assumed to exist in all affected subjects. Herein, we present two discrete instances in which this type of branding occurs. The first is that of individuals with Laron syndrome who are still called 'dwarfs' and considered as having a degree of mental retardation despite evidence showing otherwise. A similar problem, that of a girl affected with a genetic syndrome of short stature, which might include mental retardation, is also discussed. Considering that stigmatising is a form of discrimination, it concerns us all. Hence, the use of derogatory terms such as midget, dwarf or cretin, that might unintentionally occur even when delivering the best and most devoted medical care, must be eliminated.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with an estimated 17.5 million deaths annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). CVD prevention efforts have the potential to prevent the majority of these deaths by supporting guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and lifestyle modification. Mobile health (mHealth) has the potential to address this gap, but has limited evaluation in clinical studies to date. We present the case of a middle-aged patient of low socioeconomic status, with multiple comorbidities, and no prior smartphone experience, who suffered an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and was given the Corrie intervention while hospitalised. The patient demonstrated improvement in lifestyle modification, adherence to GDMT and post-MI recovery through 2.4 years follow-up. This case supports (1) the potential of mHealth interventions to enhance patient experience and outcomes, (2) intuitive design for adoption and improvement in end user experience and (3) the capability of mHealth to reach and empower underserved patients.",

        "Abstract": "In China, the ageing population and the prevalence of dementia are projected to escalate significantly by 2050 resulting in a substantial increase in health and economic burden on caregivers, healthcare facilities, healthcare providers and communities. There is no published national dementia policy or strategy in China. This case report describes significant barriers contributing to diagnostic problems and inadequate care of dementia through the case of an older female in rural China, whose condition deteriorated due to neuropsychiatric and functional symptoms of undiagnosed dementia. Intersectoral collaboration between care organisations facilitated delivery of a non-pharmacological intervention programme which was associated with improvements in the patient's functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The case demonstrates that recruitment and training of a wider range of health and care professionals and caregivers in a systematic approach to non-pharmacological interventions could help overcome barriers to the specialised care needs of people with dementia where resources are lacking.",

How the aneurysm is accessed is very important as it determines the result of the surgery. A 70-year-old man with a large coronary aneurysm (40 mm in diameter) in the LMT underwent surgery to prevent its rupture; however, there was severe adhesion. Initially, dissection of the ascending aorta or the pulmonary artery seemed necessary to access the aneurysm; however, the process was possible with limited dissection between the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery, and we succeeded in firmly closing the LMT site of entry.",

To estimate the risk of vertical transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during labour and delivery, we collected oropharyngeal, vaginal, urinary, placental and neonatal PCRs for SARS-CoV-2 during the period of admission. All PCRs, except for the oropharyngeal, were negative and vertical transmission was not observed. Labour and delivery were uncomplicated and the patient and neonate were discharged the next day. We give a short overview of the known literature about SARS-CoV-2-related infection during pregnancy, delivery and outcome of the neonate.",

        "Abstract": "We report the case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with reducible indirect inguinal hernia and a challenging constellation of symptoms, signs and radiographic findings. Surgical approach superseded conservative management when the patient's abdomen became acute, with a rising lactate and haemodynamic instability. Specifically, the presence of a fluid collection was concerning for sinister acute pathology. Our patient was rediagnosed intraoperatively with hydrocoele of canal of Nuck. This so-called 'female hydrocoele' is an eponymous anatomical rarity in general surgery, presenting as an inguinolabial swelling with variable clinical profile. Hydrocoele of canal of Nuck takes origin from failure of transitory reproductive anlagen to regress and is thus analogous to patent processus vaginalis. Its true incidence is speculative, with just several hundred cases globally. We aim to provide insights into surgical patient management for a rare entity during the COVID-19 outbreak, from the unique perspective of a small rural hospital in Scotland.",

He developed status epilepticus and became comatose, requiring intensive care unit admission for invasive ventilation. Imaging done at admission confirmed extensive cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with bilateral venous cortical infarcts and acute cortical haemorrhage. No known risk factor for CVST could be identified. He improved with anticoagulation and antiepileptic therapy. He was subsequently transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Although Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection has been previously associated with thrombotic complications, these mostly relate to the pulmonary vasculature. We present this case as a potential association between CVST and COVID-19 infection.",

        "Abstract": "A 33-year-old pregnant woman was hospitalised with fever, cough, myalgia and dyspnoea at 23.5 weeks of gestation (WG). Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mandated invasive mechanical ventilation. A nasopharyngeal swab proved positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reverse transcription-PCR. The patient developed hypertension and biological disorders suggesting pre-eclampsia and HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels and low platelet levels) syndrome. Pre-eclampsia was subsequently ruled out by a low ratio of serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 to placental growth factor. Given the severity of ARDS, delivery by caesarean section was contemplated. Because the ratio was normal and the patient's respiratory condition stabilised, delivery was postponed. She recovered after 10 days of mechanical ventilation. She spontaneously delivered a healthy boy at 33.4 WG. Clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19 infection can mimic HELLP syndrome. Fetal extraction should not be systematic in the absence of fetal distress or intractable maternal disease. Successful evolution was the result of a multidisciplinary teamwork.",

Elevated troponins and natriuretic peptides are related to cardiac injury and poor prognosis. We present a young woman with COVID-19 infection with haemodynamic instability caused by acute perimyocarditis and cardiac tamponade. Troponin T was modestly elevated. Focused cardiac ultrasound made the diagnosis. Echocardiography revealed transient thickening of the myocardial walls. After pericardial drainage and supportive care, she improved significantly within 1 week without targeted therapy. The case illustrates the importance of cardiac diagnostic imaging in patients with COVID-19 and elevated cardiac biomarkers.",

There has been a palpable increase in public avoidance of hospitals, which has interfered in timely care of critical cardiovascular conditions. Complications from late presentation of myocardial infarction, which had become a rarity, resurfaced during the pandemic. We present two such encounters that occurred due to delay in seeking medical care following myocardial infarction due to the fear of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital. Moreover, a comprehensive review of literature is performed to illustrate the potential factors delaying and decreasing timely presentations and interventions for time-dependent medical emergencies like ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We emphasise that clinicians should remain vigilant of encountering rare and catastrophic complications of STEMI during this current era of COVID-19 pandemic.",

We discuss the differential diagnosis of these findings, and the possible mechanisms of hepatic injury in COVID-19. The low lying placenta in this patient meant that we had to carefully consider the application of recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant COVID-19 patients.

Per the facility, the patient had a fever and non-productive cough. On admission, the patient was afebrile and lacked subjective symptoms. A RNA reverse transcriptase PCR (RNA RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 was positive. A chest X-ray contained a small patchy opacity in the right middle lobe and another in the retrocardiac region concerning for pneumonia. Inflammatory markers were mildly elevated. He remained COVID-19 positive and asymptomatic for 36 days. This case details one asymptomatic carrier's course with persistently positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs.

Early reports from China stated that children seem to be unharmed by its dangerous effects, yet more recently there has been evidence of a systemic inflammatory response in a small number of children who are affected. We discuss a 5-week-old male infant who presented atypically with severe COVID-19 infection. To our knowledge, he is the youngest reported case in the UK to require mechanical ventilation and intensive care treatment as a direct result of COVID-19 following horizontal transmission. This case has generated several learning points with regard to atypical presentations of COVID-19 and identifying a potential cohort of 'at risk' infants.

We examined the case of a local government employee suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and bipolar II disorder following the Great East Japan Earthquake. The complex and harsh experience provoked a hypomanic response such as elated feelings with increased energy, decreased need for sleep and an increase in goal-directed activity, which allowed him to continue working, even though he was adversely affected by the disaster. However, 3.5 years later, when he suffered further psychological damage, his PTSD symptoms became evident. In addition to treating mood disorders, trauma-focused psychotherapy was required for his recovery. Thereafter, we considered the characteristics of mental health problems that emerge in disaster-relief workers, a long time after the disaster, and the conditions and treatments necessary for recovery.",

        "Abstract": "We present a case of non-convulsive status epilepticus in a 57-year-old woman with a schizoaffective disorder, without an antecedent seizure history, with two possible aetiologies including SARS-CoV-2 infection and clozapine uptitration. We discuss the presentation, investigations, differential diagnosis and management. In particular, we focus on the electroencephalogram (EEG) findings seen in this case and the electroclinical response to antiepileptic medication. We review the literature and discuss the relevance of this case to the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic. We emphasise the importance of considering possible neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight seizure disorder as one of the possible presentations. In addition, we discuss the possible effects of clozapine on the electroclinical presentation by way of possible seizure induction as well as discuss the possible EEG changes and we highlight that this needs to be kept in mind especially during rapid titration.",

With many regions suspending the provision of non-essential healthcare services, there is a risk that patients with common treatable illnesses do not receive prompt treatment, leading to more serious and complex presentations at a later date. Lemierre's syndrome is a potentially life-threatening and under-recognised sequela of an oropharyngeal or dental infection. It is characterised by septic embolisation of the gram-negative bacillus  to a variety of different organs, most commonly to the lungs. Thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein is frequently identified. We describe an atypical case of Lemierre's syndrome involving the brain, liver and lungs following a dental infection in a young male who delayed seeking dental or medical attention due to a lack of routine services and concerns about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak."

The exact pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown, with the most likely causative factor being following a viral infection. Immediate steroids are the best treatment to improve prognosis. Despite a plethora of papers in the literature describing SSNHL, there are only a few reported cases of hearing loss following COVID-19, none of which have been reported in the UK. This paper presents the first UK case of SSNHL following COVID-19. Physical examination and imaging excluded any other cause of hearing loss. A literature review showed that four other cases have been previously described. Hearing loss can be a significant cause of morbidity and can easily be missed in the intensive care setting. Being aware and screening for SSNHL following COVID-19 enables an early course of steroids, which offers the best chance of recovering hearing.",

These are generally older patients with severe infection and comorbidities. Here we discuss the case of a previously fit and well 39-year-old man who presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, evolving in pneumonia with hypoxia but only requiring continuous positive airway pressure. After resolution of the respiratory disease, the patient developed focal neurology and was found to have bilateral occipital, thalamic and cerebellar infarcts. A diagnosis of COVID-19 central nervous system vasculopathy was made. He developed a florid neuropsychiatric syndrome, including paranoia, irritability, aggression and disinhibition, requiring treatment with antipsychotics and transfer to neurorehabilitation. Neuropsychometry revealed a wide range of cognitive deficits. The rapid evolution of the illness was matched by fast resolution of the neuropsychiatric picture with mild residual cognitive impairment.",

Recently, it has been recognised that COVID-19 may present in multi-systemic ways which can cause diagnostic uncertainty or error.We present a patient who attended hospital with features of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) before developing clinical and radiological findings of COVID-19. While the authors recognise that neurological complications have been reported following COVID-19 infection, to their knowledge this report describes a unique presentation of GBS without preceding COVID-19 symptoms.Since these conditions may have considerable overlapping features including respiratory failure and (following prolonged critical care admission) profound weakness, it is possible that one diagnosis may be overlooked. Raising awareness of a possible association between these conditions is important so both are considered allowing appropriate investigations to be arranged to optimise the chance of neurological recovery and survival, while also protecting staff from potentially unrecognised COVID-19.",
