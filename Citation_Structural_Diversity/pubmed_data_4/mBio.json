                "#text": "Antigenic or phenotypic variation is a widespread phenomenon of expression of variable surface protein coats on eukaryotic microbes. To clarify the mechanism behind mutually exclusive gene expression, we characterized the genetic properties of the surface antigen multigene family in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia and the epigenetic factors controlling expression and silencing. Genome analysis indicated that the multigene family consists of intrachromosomal and subtelomeric genes; both classes apparently derive from different gene duplication events: whole-genome and intrachromosomal duplication. Expression analysis provides evidence for telomere position effects, because only subtelomeric genes follow mutually exclusive transcription. Microarray analysis of cultures deficient in Rdr3, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, in comparison to serotype-pure wild-type cultures, shows cotranscription of a subset of subtelomeric genes, indicating that the telomere position effect is due to a selective occurrence of Rdr3-mediated silencing in subtelomeric regions. We present a model of surface antigen evolution by intrachromosomal gene duplication involving the maintenance of positive selection of structurally relevant regions. Further analysis of chromosome heterogeneity shows that alternative telomere addition regions clearly affect transcription of closely related genes. Consequently, chromosome fragmentation appears to be of crucial importance for surface antigen expression and evolution. Our data suggest that RNAi-mediated control of this genetic network by trans-acting RNAs allows rapid epigenetic adaptation by phenotypic variation in combination with long-term genetic adaptation by Darwinian evolution of antigen genes."

Mechanisms controlling gene expression of variable surface proteins therefore represent a powerful tool for rapid phenotypic variation across kingdoms in pathogenic as well as free-living eukaryotic microbes. However, the epigenetic mechanisms controlling synchronous expression and silencing of individual genes are hardly understood. Using the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia as a (epi)genetic model, we showed that a subtelomeric gene position effect is associated with the selective occurrence of RNAi-mediated silencing of silent surface protein genes, suggesting small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated epigenetic cross talks between silent and active surface antigen genes. Our integrated genomic and molecular approach discloses the correlation between gene position effects and siRNA-mediated trans-silencing, thus providing two new parameters for regulation of mutually exclusive gene expression and the genomic organization of variant gene families."

        "Abstract": "Until recently, Ebola virus (EBOV) was a rarely encountered human pathogen that caused disease among small populations with extraordinarily high lethality. At the end of 2013, EBOV initiated an unprecedented disease outbreak in West Africa that is still ongoing and has already caused thousands of deaths. Recent studies revealed the genomic changes this particular EBOV variant undergoes over time during human-to-human transmission. Here we highlight the genomic changes that might negatively impact the efficacy of currently available EBOV sequence-based candidate therapeutics, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), and antibodies. Ten of the observed mutations modify the sequence of the binding sites of monoclonal antibody (MAb) 13F6, MAb 1H3, MAb 6D8, MAb 13C6, and siRNA EK-1, VP24, and VP35 targets and might influence the binding efficacy of the sequence-based therapeutics, suggesting that their efficacy should be reevaluated against the currently circulating strain.",

In our previous study, microRNA-146a (miR-146a), an innate immunity-related miRNA, and complement factor H (CFH), an important negative regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation, were differentially expressed in HBV-expressing and HBV-free hepatocytes. Here, the roles of these factors in HBV-related liver inflammation were analyzed in detail. The expression levels of miR-146a and CFH in HBV-expressing hepatocytes were assessed via analyses of hepatocyte cell lines, transgenic mice, adenovirus-infected mice, and HBV-positive human liver samples. The expression level of miR-146a was upregulated in HBV-expressing Huh-7 hepatocytes, HBV-expressing mice, and patients with HBV infection. Further results demonstrated that the HBV X protein (HBx) was responsible for its effects on miR-146a expression through NF-κB-mediated enhancement of miR-146a promoter activity. HBV/HBx also downregulated the expression of CFH mRNA in hepatocyte cell lines and the livers of humans and transgenic mice. Furthermore, overexpression and inhibition of miR-146a in Huh-7 cells downregulated and upregulated CFH mRNA levels, respectively. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-146a downregulated CFH mRNA expression in hepatocytes via 3'-untranslated-region (UTR) pairing. The overall effect of this process in vivo is to promote liver inflammation. These results demonstrate that the HBx-miR-146a-CFH-complement activation regulation pathway might play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of chronic HBV infection. These findings have important implications for understanding the immunopathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B and developing effective therapeutic interventions."

CPB results from synonymous codons that are paired more or less frequently in ORFeomes regardless of codon bias. The effect of an individual codon pair change is usually small, but when it is amplified by large-scale genome recoding, strikingly altered biological phenotypes are observed. The utility of codon pair bias in the development of live attenuated vaccines was recently demonstrated by recodings of poliovirus (a positive-strand RNA virus) and influenza virus (a negative-strand segmented RNA virus). Here, the L gene of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus, was partially recoded based on codon pair bias. Totals of 858 and 623 silent mutations were introduced into a 5'-terminal segment of the viral L gene (designated L1) to create sequences containing either overrepresented or underrepresented codon pairs, designated L1(sdmax) and L1(min), respectively. Analysis revealed that recombinant VSV containing the L1(min) sequence could not be recovered, whereas the virus with the sdmax sequence showed a modest level of attenuation in cell culture. More strikingly, in mice the L1(sdmax) virus was almost as immunogenic as the parental strain but highly attenuated. Taken together, these results open a new road to attain a balance between VSV virulence and immunogenicity, which could serve as an example for the attenuation of other negative-strand, nonsegmented RNA viruses."

Recombinant VSVs with distinct codon pair biases were rationally designed, constructed, and analyzed in both cell culture and an animal model. One such recombinant virus, L1(sdmax), contained extra overrepresented codon pairs in its L gene open reading frame (ORF) and showed promise as an effective vaccine candidate because of a favorable balance between virulence and immunogenicity.

In the transcriptomes obtained under adverse conditions encountered during bacterial infection, we explored the patterns of chromosomal DNA sequence organization, supercoil dynamics, and gene expression densities, together with the long-range regulatory impacts of the abundant DNA architectural proteins implicated in pathogenicity control.

        "Abstract": "The best way to combat influenza virus infection is to prevent it. However, the continual evolution of circulating influenza virus strains and the constant threat of newly emerging viruses forces the public health community to annually update seasonal influenza vaccines while stockpiling potential pandemic virus vaccines. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a \"universal\" influenza vaccine that affords protection against all strains. In their recent article, L. M. Schwartzman et al. (mBio 6:e01044-15, 2015, doi:10.1128/mBio.01044-15) demonstrated that intranasal immunization of mice with a cocktail of viral-like particles (VLPs) expressing distinct influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) proteins can broadly protect against infection not only with the same viral strains but also with unrelated strains. These findings suggest a promising strategy for developing a broadly protective \"universal\" influenza vaccine. ",

The obsession with IF has been compared to a medical condition, sometimes referred to as \"IF mania\" or \"impactitis.\" Here, we analyze the difference between impact and importance, using examples from the history of science to show that these are not equivalent. If impact does not necessarily equal importance, but scientists are focused on high-impact work, there is a danger that misuse of the IF may adversely affect scientific progress. We suggest five measures to fight this malady: (i) diversify journal club selections, (ii) do not judge science on the publication venue, (iii) reduce the reliance on journal citation metrics for employment and advancement, (iv) discuss the misuse of the IF in ethics courses, and (v) cite the most appropriate sources. If IF mania is indeed a medical condition, the most appropriate course of action may be disimpaction. ",

One of these host proteins is a cellular DNA repair enzyme known as 5' tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2). TDP2 was previously demonstrated to mediate the cleavage of a unique covalent linkage between a viral protein (VPg) and the 5' end of picornavirus RNAs. Although VPg is absent from actively translating poliovirus mRNAs, the removal of VPg is not required for the in vitro translation and replication of the RNA. However, TDP2 appears to be excluded from replication and encapsidation sites during peak times of poliovirus infection of HeLa cells, suggesting a role for TDP2 during the viral replication cycle. Using a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking TDP2, we found that TDP2 is differentially required among enteroviruses. Our single-cycle viral growth analysis shows that CVB3 replication has a greater dependency on TDP2 than does poliovirus or human rhinovirus replication. During infection, CVB3 protein accumulation is undetectable (by Western blot analysis) in the absence of TDP2, whereas poliovirus protein accumulation is reduced but still detectable. Using an infectious CVB3 RNA with a reporter, CVB3 RNA could still be replicated in the absence of TDP2 following transfection, albeit at reduced levels. Overall, these results indicate that TDP2 potentiates viral replication during enterovirus infections of cultured cells, making TDP2 a potential target for antiviral development for picornavirus infections."

Human rhinovirus is the causative agent of the common cold, which has a severe economic impact due to lost productivity and severe health consequences in individuals with respiratory dysfunction, such as asthma. By gaining a better understanding of the enterovirus replication cycle, antiviral drugs against enteroviruses may be developed.

Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are suggested to contribute to a viral bottleneck during MTCT, but their role in blocking transmission is unclear, as studies comparing the NAb sensitivities of maternal viruses have yielded disparate results. We sought to determine whether transmitting mothers differ from nontransmitting mothers in the ability to neutralize individual autologous virus variants present at transmission. Ten transmitting and 10 nontransmitting HIV-infected mothers at high risk of MTCT were included in this study. Full-length HIV envelope genes (n = 100) were cloned from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained near transmission from transmitting mothers and at similar time points from nontransmitting mothers. Envelope clones were tested as pseudoviruses against contemporaneous, autologous maternal plasma in neutralization assays. The association between transmission and the log2 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for multiple virus variants per mother was estimated by using logistic regression with clustered standard errors. t tests were used to compare proportions of neutralization-resistant viruses. Overall, transmitting mothers had a median IC50 of 317 (interquartile range [IQR], 202 to 521), and nontransmitting mothers had a median IC50 of 243 (IQR, 95 to 594). Transmission risk was not significantly associated with autologous NAb activity (odds ratio, 1.25; P = 0.3). Compared to nontransmitting mothers, transmitting mothers had similar numbers of or fewer neutralization-resistant virus variants, depending on the IC50 neutralization resistance cutoff. In conclusion, HIV-infected mothers harbor mostly neutralization-sensitive viruses, although resistant variants were detected in both transmitting and nontransmitting mothers. These results suggest that MTCT during the breastfeeding period is not driven solely by the presence of maternal neutralization escape variants."

Results of these studies have varied, perhaps because of differences in methods. Importantly, studies often used cultured viruses and samples from time points outside the window of transmission, which could confound findings. Here, we considered the role of maternal NAbs against individual maternal virus variants near the time of transmission. We found no evidence that NAbs are associated with protection from infection. In fact, depending on the cutoff used to define neutralization resistance, we found evidence that nontransmitting mothers have more neutralization-resistant virus variants. These results suggest that lack of virus transmission in the early breastfeeding period is not simply due to an absence of maternal neutralization escape variants and likely includes multiple factors."

A major component of the immune response to influenza virus is the production of type I and III interferons. Here we show that the immune response to infection with influenza virus causes an increase and restructuring of the upper respiratory microbiota in wild-type (WT) mice but not in Il28r(-/-) mutant mice lacking the receptor for type III interferon. Mice lacking the IL-28 receptor fail to induce STAT1 phosphorylation and expression of its regulator, SOCS1. Il28r(-/-) mutant mice have increased expression of interleukin-22 (IL-22), as well as Ngal and RegIIIγ, in the nasal cavity, the source of organisms that would be aspirated to cause pneumonia. Proteomic analysis reveals changes in several cytoskeletal proteins that contribute to barrier function in the nasal epithelium that may contribute to the effects of IL-28 signaling on the microbiota. The importance of the effects of IL-28 signaling in the pathogenesis of MRSA pneumonia after influenza virus infection was confirmed by showing that WT mice nasally colonized before or after influenza virus infection had significantly higher levels of infection in the upper airways, as well as significantly greater susceptibility to MRSA pneumonia than Il28r(-/-) mutant mice did. Our results suggest that activation of the type III interferon in response to influenza virus infection has a major effect in expanding the upper airway microbiome and increasing susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infection."

To gain insights into the molecular basis of acute Lyme disease and the ensuing development of post-treatment symptoms, we conducted a longitudinal transcriptome study of 29 Lyme disease patients (and 13 matched controls) enrolled at the time of diagnosis and followed for up to 6 months. The differential gene expression signature of Lyme disease following the acute phase of infection persisted for at least 3 weeks and had fewer than 44% differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in common with other infectious or noninfectious syndromes. Early Lyme disease prior to antibiotic therapy was characterized by marked upregulation of Toll-like receptor signaling but lack of activation of the inflammatory T-cell apoptotic and B-cell developmental pathways seen in other acute infectious syndromes. Six months after completion of therapy, Lyme disease patients were found to have 31 to 60% of their pathways in common with three different immune-mediated chronic diseases. No differential gene expression signature was observed between Lyme disease patients with resolved illness to those with persistent symptoms at 6 months post-treatment. The identification of a sustained differential gene expression signature in Lyme disease suggests that a panel of selected human host-based biomarkers may address the need for sensitive clinical diagnostics during the \"window period\" of infection prior to the appearance of a detectable antibody response and may also inform the development of new therapeutic targets."

However, the genome-wide targets of Cst6p and its physiological functions remain unknown. Here, we mapped the genome-wide binding sites of Cst6p at high resolution. Cst6p binds to the promoter regions of 59 genes with various biological functions when cells are grown on ethanol but hardly binds to the promoter at any gene when cells are grown on glucose. The retarded growth of the CST6 deletion mutant on ethanol is attributed to the markedly decreased expression of NCE103, encoding a carbonic anhydrase, which is a direct target of Cst6p. The target genes of Cst6p have a large overlap with those of stress-responsive transcription factors, such as Sko1p and Skn7p. In addition, a CST6 deletion mutant growing on ethanol shows hypersensitivity to oxidative stress and ethanol stress, assigning Cst6p as a new member of the stress-responsive transcriptional regulatory network. These results show that mapping of genome-wide binding sites can provide new insights into the function of transcription factors and highlight the highly connected and condition-dependent nature of the transcriptional regulatory network in S. cerevisiae"

        "Abstract": "Although the current cholera pandemic can trace its origin to a specific time and place, many variants of Vibrio cholerae have caused this disease over the last 50 years. The relative clinical importance and geographical distribution of these variants have changed with time, but most remain in circulation. Some countries, such as Mexico and Haiti, had escaped the current pandemic, until large epidemics struck them in 1991 and 2010, respectively. Cholera has been endemic in these countries ever since. A recent retrospective study in mBio presents the results of more than 3 decades of V. cholerae monitoring from environmental and clinical sources in Mexico (S. Y. Choi et al., mBio 7:e02160-15, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.02160-15). It reveals that multiple V. cholerae variants, including classical strains from the previous pandemic, as well as completely novel biotypes, have been circulating in Mexico. This discovery has important implications for the epidemiology and evolution of V. cholerae.",

This MTC pathogen did not appear to be transmitted through a primary aerosol or oral route. We utilized histopathology, spoligotyping, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR), quantitative PCR (qPCR), and molecular markers (regions of difference [RDs] from various MTC members, including region of difference 1 [RD1] from M. bovis BCG [RD1(BCG)], M. microti [RD1(mic)], and M. pinnipedii [RD1(seal)], genes Rv1510 [RD4], Rv1970 [RD7], Rv3877/8 [RD1], and Rv3120 [RD12], insertion element IS1561, the 16S RNA gene, and gene Rv0577 [cfp32]), including the newly characterized mongoose-specific deletion in RD1 (RD1(mon)), in order to demonstrate the presence of M. mungi DNA in infected mongooses and investigate pathogen invasion and exposure mechanisms. M. mungi DNA was identified in 29% of nasal planum samples (n = 52), 56% of nasal rinses and swabs (n = 9), 53% of oral swabs (n = 19), 22% of urine samples (n = 23), 33% of anal gland tissue (n = 18), and 39% of anal gland secretions (n = 44). The occurrence of extremely low cycle threshold values obtained with qPCR in anal gland and nasal planum samples indicates that high levels of M. mungi can be found in these tissue types. Histological data were consistent with these results, suggesting that pathogen invasion occurs through breaks in the nasal planum and/or skin of the mongoose host, which are in frequent contact with anal gland secretions and urine during olfactory communication behavior. Lesions in the lung, when present, occurred only with disseminated disease. No environmental sources of M. mungi DNA could be found. We report primary environmental transmission of an MTC pathogen that occurs in association with social communication behavior."

We report a novel mode of environmental infectious disease transmission that occurs in association with olfactory secretions (e.g., urine and anal gland secretions), allowing pathogen exposure to occur within and between social groups through intricate social communication behaviors of the banded mongoose host. The presence of M. mungi in these environmentally deposited secretions would effectively circumvent natural social barriers (e.g., territoriality), facilitating between-group pathogen transmission in the absence of direct physical contact, a rare occurrence in this highly territorial species. This work identifies an important potential mechanism of pathogen transmission of epidemiological significance in social species. We also provide evidence of a novel mechanism of pathogen transmission for the MTC complex, where pathogen movement in the environment and host exposure dynamics are driven by social behavior."

The fungal cell wall is an essential organelle which undergoes constant modification during various stages of growth and is critical for fungal pathogenesis. One critical component of the fungal cell wall is chitin, which in C. neoformans is predominantly deacetylated to chitosan. We previously reported that three chitin deacetylase (CDA) genes have to be deleted to generate a chitosan-deficient C. neoformans strain. This cda1Δ2Δ3Δ strain was avirulent in mice, as it was rapidly cleared from the lungs of infected mice. Here, we report that clearance of the cda1Δ2Δ3Δ strain was associated with sharply spiked concentrations of proinflammatory molecules that are known to be critical mediators of the orchestration of a protective Th1-type adaptive immune response. This was followed by the selective enrichment of the Th1-type T cell population in the cda1Δ2Δ3Δ strain-infected mouse lung. Importantly, this response resulted in the development of robust protective immunity to a subsequent lethal challenge with a virulent wild-type C. neoformans strain. Moreover, protective immunity was also induced in mice vaccinated with heat-killed cda1Δ2Δ3Δ cells and was effective in multiple mouse strains. The results presented here provide a strong framework to develop the cda1Δ2Δ3Δ strain as a potential vaccine candidate for C. neoformans infection."

Major drawbacks of these treatment options are their limited efficacy, poor availability in limited resource areas, and potential toxicity. The development of antifungal vaccines and immune-based therapeutic interventions is promising and an attractive alternative to chemotherapeutics. Currently, there are no fungal vaccines in clinical use. This is the first report of a C. neoformans deletion strain with an avirulent phenotype in mice exhibiting protective immunity when used as a vaccine after heat inactivation, although other strains that overexpress fungal or murine proteins have recently been shown to induce a protective response.

                "#text": "While considerable research has focused on the properties of individual bacteria, relatively little is known about how microbial interspecies interactions alter bacterial behaviors and pathogenesis. Staphylococcus aureus frequently coinfects with other pathogens in a range of different infectious diseases. For example, coinfection by S. aureus with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs commonly in people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with higher lung disease morbidity and mortality. S. aureus secretes numerous exoproducts that are known to interact with host tissues, influencing inflammatory responses. The abundantly secreted S. aureus staphylococcal protein A (SpA) binds a range of human glycoproteins, immunoglobulins, and other molecules, with diverse effects on the host, including inhibition of phagocytosis of S. aureus cells. However, the potential effects of SpA and other S. aureus exoproducts on coinfecting bacteria have not been explored. Here, we show that S. aureus-secreted products, including SpA, significantly alter two behaviors associated with persistent infection. We found that SpA inhibited biofilm formation by specific P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, and it also inhibited phagocytosis by neutrophils of all isolates tested. Our results indicate that these effects were mediated by binding to at least two P. aeruginosa cell surface structures-type IV pili and the exopolysaccharide Psl-that confer attachment to surfaces and to other bacterial cells. Thus, we found that the role of a well-studied S. aureus exoproduct, SpA, extends well beyond interactions with the host immune system. Secreted SpA alters multiple persistence-associated behaviors of another common microbial community member, likely influencing cocolonization and coinfection with other microbes."

However, the contribution of these RND pumps to cell fitness and virulence has not yet been studied. The biological cost of an antibiotic resistance mechanism is a key parameter in determining its stability and dissemination. From an entirely sequenced susceptible clinical isolate, we have generated a set of isogenic derivatives having single point mutations resulting in overexpression of each efflux system or with every pump deleted by allelic replacement. We found that overproduction of the pumps results in a significant decrease in fitness of the bacterial host when measured by competition experiments in vitro Fitness and virulence were also evaluated in vivo both in systemic and pulmonary infection models in immunocompetent mice. A diminished competitiveness of the AdeABC-overexpressing mutant was observed only after intraperitoneal inoculation, but not after intranasal inoculation, the latter mimicking the most frequent type of human A. baumannii infection. However, in mice infected intranasally, this mutant was more virulent and stimulated an enhanced neutrophil activation in the lungs. Altogether, these data account for the observation that adeABC overexpression is common in MDR A. baumannii frequently found in ventilator-associated pneumonia."

It was therefore important to study the biological cost of the overexpression of the adeABC structural operon which is normally tightly regulated. Fitness diminution of an overexpressing mutant detected in vitro and in vivo in a model that mimics sepsis was not observed in a pulmonary infection model in which the mutant was more virulent. This points out that increased virulence can occur independently from prolonged persistence in the infected organ and can account for the elevated incidence of this resistance mechanism in clinical isolates. The study also indicates that transposon libraries will identify only virulence genes that are expressed under physiological conditions but not those that are tightly regulated."

        "Abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most common parasitic infections of humans worldwide. Once exposed, humans remain infected with T. gondii for life, and there are no therapeutics capable of eliminating a chronic infection. In the search for novel drug targets, T. gondii is known to contain several unique secretory organelles, one of which is called the rhoptries. Rhoptry organelles contain and secrete numerous proteins with kinase domains, but the roles of most of these kinases during infection remain unknown. In a recent mBio article, B. A. Fox et al. [mBio 7(3):e00193-16, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00193-16] performed a tour de force deletion analysis of 31 rhoptry kinases and examined their roles in the development of chronic infection. While rhoptry kinase deletion strains that displayed an acute infection defect also showed a reduction in chronic infection cyst burden, two rhoptry kinase deletion strains had decreased cyst burden without any change in acute virulence. These results indicate the necessity of the rhoptry kinases for the establishment and perhaps maintenance of chronic infection. They also highlight the potential of these kinases as drug targets to clear chronic infection or as candidates to generate a nonpersisting vaccine.",

S. meliloti mutants that cannot make succinoglycan cannot initiate invasion structures called infection threads in plant root hairs. S. meliloti exoH mutants that cannot succinylate succinoglycan are also unable to form infection threads, despite the fact that they make large quantities of succinoglycan. Succinoglycan produced by exoH mutants is refractory to cleavage by the glycanases encoded by exoK and exsH, and thus succinoglycan produced by exoH mutants is made only in the high-molecular-weight (HMW) form. One interpretation of the symbiotic defect of exoH mutants is that the low-molecular-weight (LMW) form of succinoglycan is required for infection thread formation. However, our data demonstrate that production of the HMW form of succinoglycan by S. meliloti 1021 is sufficient for invasion of the host M. truncatula and that the LMW form is not required. Here, we show that S. meliloti strains deficient in the exoK- and exsH-encoded glycanases invade M. truncatula and form a productive symbiosis, although they do this with somewhat less efficiency than the wild type. We have also characterized the polysaccharides produced by these double glycanase mutants and determined that they consist of only HMW succinoglycan and no detectable LMW succinoglycan. This demonstrates that LMW succinoglycan is not required for host invasion. These results suggest succinoglycan function is not dependent upon the presence of a small, readily diffusible form."

In addition, we discovered that the presence of S. gordonii enhances the bioavailability of oxygen during infection, allowing A. actinomycetemcomitans to shift from a primarily fermentative to a respiratory metabolism that enhances its growth yields and persistence. Mechanistically, respiratory metabolism enhances the fitness of A. actinomycetemcomitans in vivo by increasing ATP yields via central metabolism and creating a proton motive force. Our results reveal that, similar to cross-feeding, where one species provides another species with a nutrient, commensal bacteria can also provide electron acceptors that promote the respiratory growth and fitness of pathogens in vivo, an interaction that we term cross-respiration."

For example, among different nitrogen sources, ammonium is the preferred nitrogen source, supporting fast growth, whereas alternative nitrogen sources, such as certain amino acids, are considered to be poor nitrogen sources, supporting much slower exponential growth. However, the physiological/regulatory logic behind such nitrogen dietary choices remains elusive. In this study, by engineering Escherichia coli, we switched the dietary preferences toward amino acids, with growth rates equivalent to that of the wild-type strain grown on ammonia. However, when the engineered strain was cultured together with wild-type E. coli, this growth advantage was diminished as a consequence of ammonium leakage from the transport-and-catabolism (TC)-enhanced (TCE) cells, which are preferentially utilized by wild-type bacteria. Our results reveal that the nitrogen regulatory (Ntr) system fine tunes the expression of amino acid transport and catabolism components to match the flux through the ammonia assimilation pathway such that essential nutrients are retained, but, as a consequence, the fast growth rate on amino acids is sacrificed."

These environmentally related behaviors reflect the coordination between metabolism and the underlying regulatory networks. In the present study, we investigated the intertwined nitrogen metabolic and nitrogen regulatory systems to understand the growth differences between rich and poor nitrogen sources. Although maximal growth rate is considered to be evolutionarily advantageous for bacteria (as remarked by François Jacob, who said that the \"dream\" of every cell is to become two cells), we showed that negative-feedback loops in the regulatory system inhibit growth rates on amino acids. We demonstrated that in the absence of regulatory feedback, amino acids are capable of supporting fast growth rates, but this results in ammonia leaking out from cells as \"waste,\" benefiting the growth of competitors. These findings provide important insights into the regulatory logic that controls metabolic flux and ensures nutrient containment but consequently sacrifices growth rate."

Here we found that clinical strains of C. glabrata exhibit cell-to-cell variation in drug response (heteroresistance). We used population analysis profiling (PAP) to assess fluconazole heteroresistance (FLC(HR)) and to ask if it is a binary trait or a continuous phenotype. Thirty (57.6%) of 52 fluconazole-sensitive clinical C. glabrata isolates met accepted dichotomous criteria for FLC(HR) However, quantitative grading of FLC(HR) by using the area under the PAP curve (AUC) revealed a continuous distribution across a wide range of values, suggesting that all isolates exhibit some degree of heteroresistance. The AUC correlated with rhodamine 6G efflux and was associated with upregulation of the CDR1 and PDH1 genes, encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transmembrane transporters, implying that HetR populations exhibit higher levels of drug efflux. Highly FLC(HR) C. glabrata was recovered more frequently than nonheteroresistant C. glabrata from hematogenously infected immunocompetent mice following treatment with high-dose fluconazole (45.8% versus 15%, P = 0.029). Phylogenetic analysis revealed some phenotypic clustering but also variations in FLC(HR) within clonal groups, suggesting both genetic and epigenetic determinants of heteroresistance. Collectively, these results establish heteroresistance to fluconazole as a graded phenotype associated with ABC transporter upregulation and fluconazole efflux. Heteroresistance may explain the propensity of C. glabrata for persistent infection and the emergence of breakthrough resistance to fluconazole."

The establishment of latency in B cells is thought to involve active virus engagement of host signaling pathways. Pathogenic effects of these viruses during latency or following reactivation can be devastating to the host. Many cancers, including those associated with members of the gammaherpesvirus family, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus, express elevated levels of active host signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). STAT3 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to many cytokines and can orchestrate effector responses that include proliferation, inflammation, metastasis, and developmental programming. However, the contribution of STAT3 to gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis remains to be completely understood. This is the first study to have identified STAT3 as a critical host determinant of the ability of gammaherpesvirus to establish long-term latency in an animal model of disease. Following an acute infection, murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) established latency in resident B cells, but establishment of latency was dramatically reduced in animals with a B cell-specific STAT3 deletion. The lack of STAT3 in B cells did not impair germinal center responses for immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching in the spleen and did not reduce either total or virus-specific IgG titers. Although ablation of STAT3 in B cells did not have a global effect on these assays of B cell function, it had long-term consequences for the viral load of the host, since virus latency was reduced at 6 to 8 weeks postinfection. Our findings establish host STAT3 as a mediator of gammaherpesvirus persistence."

Identification of host factors that promote viral latency is essential for understanding latency mechanisms and for therapeutic interventions. We provide the first evidence that STAT3 expression is needed for murine gammaherpesvirus 68 to establish latency in primary B cells during an active immune response to infection. STAT3 deletion in B cells does not impair adaptive immune control of the virus, but loss of STAT3 in B cells has a long-lasting impact on viral persistence. These results indicate a potential therapeutic benefit of STAT3 inhibitors for combating gammaherpesvirus latency and, thereby, associated pathologies."

To gain insights into the characteristic biofilm phenotype of P. aeruginosa in the CF lungs, mimicking the CF lung environment is critical. We previously showed that growth of the non-CF-adapted P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain in a rotating wall vessel, a device that simulates the low fluid shear (LS) conditions present in the CF lung, leads to the formation of in-suspension, self-aggregating biofilms. In the present study, we determined the phenotypic and transcriptomic changes associated with the growth of a highly adapted, transmissible P. aeruginosa CF strain in artificial sputum medium under LS conditions. Robust self-aggregating biofilms were observed only under LS conditions. Growth under LS conditions resulted in the upregulation of genes involved in stress response, alginate biosynthesis, denitrification, glycine betaine biosynthesis, glycerol metabolism, and cell shape maintenance, while genes involved in phenazine biosynthesis, type VI secretion, and multidrug efflux were downregulated. In addition, a number of small RNAs appeared to be involved in the response to shear stress. Finally, quorum sensing was found to be slightly but significantly affected by shear stress, resulting in higher production of autoinducer molecules during growth under high fluid shear (HS) conditions. In summary, our study revealed a way to modulate the behavior of a highly adapted P. aeruginosa CF strain by means of introducing shear stress, driving it from a biofilm lifestyle to a more planktonic lifestyle."

N. meningitidis is also a common inhabitant of the human nasopharynx and, as such, is highly adapted to its niche. During bacteremia, N. meningitidis gains access to the blood compartment, where it adheres to endothelial cells of blood vessels and causes dramatic vascular damage. Colonization of the nasopharyngeal niche and communication with the different human cell types is a major issue of the N. meningitidis life cycle that is poorly understood. Here, highly saturated random transposon insertion libraries of N. meningitidis were engineered, and the fitness of mutations during routine growth and that of colonization of endothelial and epithelial cells in a flow device were assessed in a transposon insertion site sequencing (Tn-seq) analysis. This allowed the identification of genes essential for bacterial growth and genes specifically required for host cell colonization. In addition, after having identified the small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) located in intergenic regions, the phenotypes associated with mutations in those sRNAs were defined. A total of 383 genes and 8 intergenic regions containing sRNA candidates were identified to be essential for growth, while 288 genes and 33 intergenic regions containing sRNA candidates were found to be specifically required for host cell colonization."

Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) is also a commensal bacterium of the nasopharynx and is carried by 3 to 30% of healthy humans. Under some unknown circumstances, N. meningitidis is able to invade the bloodstream and cause either meningitis or a fatal septicemia known as purpura fulminans. The onset of symptoms is sudden, and death can follow within hours. Although many meningococcal virulence factors have been identified, the mechanisms that allow the bacterium to switch from the commensal to pathogen state remain unknown. Therefore, we used a Tn-seq strategy coupled to high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies to find genes for proteins used by N. meningitidis to specifically colonize epithelial cells and primary brain endothelial cells.

In bacteria, the cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling network is one of several signal transduction systems that regulate key processes in response to extra-/intracellular stimuli. Here, we find that the diguanylate cyclase YfiN acts as a bifunctional protein that produces c-di-GMP in response to reductive stress and then dynamically relocates to the division site to arrest cell division in response to envelope stress in Escherichia coli YfiN localizes to the Z ring by interacting with early division proteins and stalls cell division by preventing the initiation of septal peptidoglycan synthesis. These studies reveal a new role for a diguanylate cyclase in responding to environmental change, as well as a novel mechanism for arresting cell division."

This work reports an unexpected second role for YfiN, a conserved diguanylate cyclase in Gram-negative bacteria, known to contribute to persistence in the host. We find that YfiN acts as a cell division inhibitor in response to envelope stress. Unlike known cell division inhibitors, the interaction of YfiN with cell division proteins retains the Z ring at the midcell but prevents septal invagination. The new function of YfiN not only emphasizes the versatility of c-di-GMP signaling but describes a novel mechanism for a cell division checkpoint."

A carcinogenic derivative strain, 7.13, that has a greater ability to translocate CagA exhibits much higher hydrogenase activity than its parent noncarcinogenic strain, B128. A Δhyd mutant strain with deletion of hydrogenase genes was ineffective in CagA translocation into human gastric epithelial AGS cells, while no significant attenuation of cell adhesion was observed. The quinone reductase inhibitor 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO) was used to specifically inhibit the H2-utilizing respiratory chain of outer membrane-permeabilized bacterial cells; that level of inhibitor also greatly attenuated CagA translocation into AGS cells, indicating the H2-generated transmembrane potential is a contributor to toxin translocation. The Δhyd strain showed a decreased frequency of DNA transformation, suggesting that H. pylori hydrogenase is also involved in energizing the DNA uptake apparatus. In a gerbil model of infection, the ability of the Δhyd strain to induce inflammation was significantly attenuated (at 12 weeks postinoculation), while all of the gerbils infected with the parent strain (7.13) exhibited a high level of inflammation. Gastric cancer developed in 50% of gerbils infected with the wild-type strain 7.13 but in none of the animals infected with the Δhyd strain. By examining the hydrogenase activities from well-defined clinical H. pylori isolates, we observed that strains isolated from cancer patients (n = 6) have a significantly higher hydrogenase (H2/O2) activity than the strains isolated from gastritis patients (n = 6), further supporting an association between H. pylori hydrogenase activity and gastric carcinogenesis in humans."

The role of hydrogenase in carcinogenesis is demonstrated in an animal model, whereby inflammation markers and cancer development were attenuated in the hydrogenase-null strain. Hydrogenase activity comparisons of clinical strains of the pathogen also support a connection between hydrogen metabolism and gastric cancer risk.

C. difficile, a multidrug-resistant anaerobic pathogen, causes disease by producing toxins A and B, which are controlled by an accessory gene regulator (Agr) quorum signaling system. Some C. difficile strains encode two Agr loci in their genomes, designated agr1 and agr2 The agr1 locus is present in all of the C. difficile strains sequenced to date, whereas the agr2 locus is present in a few strains. The functional roles of agr1 and agr2 in C. difficile toxin regulation and pathogenesis were unknown until now. Using allelic exchange, we deleted components of both agr loci and examined the mutants for toxin production and virulence. The results showed that the agr1 mutant cannot produce toxins A and B; toxin production can be restored by complementation with wild-type agr1 Furthermore, the agr1 mutant is able to colonize but unable to cause disease in a murine CDI model. These findings have profound implications for CDI treatment because we have uncovered a promising therapeutic target for the development of nonantibiotic drugs to treat this life-threatening emerging pathogen by targeting the toxins directly responsible for disease."

As a multidrug-resistant, spore-forming, anaerobic pathogen, C. difficile overpopulates the colon after the gut microbiota has been altered by antibiotic therapy. With increasing resistance to antibiotic treatment of C. difficile infections, patients are experiencing higher costs of health care and a lower quality of life as treatment options decrease. During infection, C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which directly cause disease. As a result, the toxins have become promising nonantibiotic treatment targets. Here, we have identified a pathway responsible for activating the production of the toxins. This important finding opens up a unique therapeutic target for the development of a novel nonantibiotic therapy for C. difficile infections."

A key presumption underlying analyses of TIS datasets is that loci with a low frequency of transposon insertions contribute to fitness. However, it is not known whether factors such as nucleoid binding proteins can alter the frequency of transposon insertion and thus whether TIS output may systematically reflect factors that are independent of the role of the loci in fitness. Here, we investigated whether the histone-like nucleoid structuring (H-NS) protein, which preferentially associates with AT-rich sequences, modulates the frequency of Mariner transposon insertion in the Vibrio cholerae genome, using comparative analysis of TIS results from wild-type (wt) and Δhns V. cholerae strains. These analyses were overlaid on gene classification based on GC content as well as on extant genome-wide identification of H-NS binding loci. Our analyses revealed a significant dearth of insertions within AT-rich loci in wt V. cholerae that was not apparent in the Δhns insertion library. Additionally, we observed a striking correlation between genetic loci that are overrepresented in the Δhns insertion library relative to their insertion frequency in wt V. cholerae and loci previously found to physically interact with H-NS. Collectively, our findings reveal that factors other than genetic fitness can systematically modulate the frequency of transposon insertions in TIS studies and add a cautionary note to interpretation of TIS data, particularly for AT-rich sequences."

We found that the presence of the DNA binding protein H-NS, which preferentially recognizes AT-rich sequences, is linked to significant underrepresentation of mutations within AT-rich loci in transposon insertion libraries. Furthermore, there is a marked correspondence between loci bound by H-NS and loci with an increased frequency of disruption in a Δhns insertion library relative to a wt library.

This study identified DNA supercoiling as playing a key role in regulating motility and flagellar protein production and found that this supercoiling-controlled regulon is induced by growth in chicken mucus. A direct correlation was observed between motility and resting DNA supercoiling levels in different strains of C. jejuni, and relaxation of DNA supercoiling resulted in decreased motility. Transcriptional analysis and Western immunoblotting revealed that a reduction in motility and DNA supercoiling affected the two-component regulatory system FlgRS and was associated with reduced FlgR expression, increased FlgS expression, and aberrant expression of flagellin subunits. Electron microscopy revealed that the flagellar structure remained intact. Growth in the presence of porcine mucin resulted in increased negative supercoiling, increased motility, increased FlgR expression, and reduced FlgS expression. Finally, this supercoiling-dependent regulon was shown to be induced by growth in chicken mucus, and the level of activation was dependent on the source of the mucus from within the chicken intestinal tract. In conclusion, this study reports for the first time the key role played by DNA supercoiling in regulating motility in C. jejuni and indicates that the induction of this supercoiling-induced regulon in response to mucus from different sources could play a critical role in regulating motility in vivo"

Altering the level of DNA supercoiling results in changes in motility levels, as well as changes in the expression of genes involved in flagellar gene regulation. Furthermore, spontaneous clones of the organism with different motility profiles have altered DNA supercoiling levels. Finally, mucus was identified as a key stimulator of changes in DNA supercoiling, and it was shown that mucus from different sites in the chicken intestine induced different levels of DNA supercoiling.

While previous studies have focused on transcription factors, we investigated the role of Escherichia coli elongation factor P (EF-P), an elongation factor required for efficient translation of mRNAs containing consecutive proline codons, in maintaining coupled translation and transcription. In the absence of EF-P, the presence of Rho utilization (rut) sites led to an ~30-fold decrease in translation of polyproline-encoding mRNAs. Coexpression of the Rho inhibitor Psu fully restored translation. EF-P was also shown to inhibit premature termination during synthesis and translation of mRNAs encoding intrinsic terminators. The effects of EF-P loss on expression of polyproline mRNAs were augmented by a substitution in RNA polymerase that accelerates transcription. Analyses of previously reported ribosome profiling and global proteomic data identified several candidate gene clusters where EF-P could act to prevent premature transcription termination. In vivo probing allowed detection of some predicted premature termination products in the absence of EF-P. Our findings support a model in which EF-P maintains coupling of translation and transcription by decreasing ribosome stalling at polyproline motifs. Other regulators that facilitate ribosome translocation through roadblocks to prevent premature transcription termination upon uncoupling remain to be identified."

Two systems widely used in Escherichia coli are the Red system from phage λ and RecET from the defective Rac prophage. We investigated the in vivo dependence of recombineering on DNA replication of the recombining substrate using plasmid targets. For λ Red recombination, when DNA replication of a circular target plasmid is prevented, recombination with single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides is greatly reduced compared to that under replicating conditions. For RecET recombination, when DNA replication of the targeted plasmid is prevented, the recombination frequency is also reduced, to a level identical to that seen for the Red system in the absence of replication. The very low level of oligonucleotide recombination observed in the absence of any phage recombination functions is the same in the presence or absence of DNA replication. In contrast, both the Red and RecET systems recombine a nonreplicating linear dimer plasmid with high efficiency to yield a circular monomer. Therefore, the DNA replication requirement is substrate dependent. Our data are consistent with recombination by both the Red and RecET systems occurring predominately by single-strand annealing rather than by strand invasion."

Single- or double-stranded linear DNA substrates containing short flanking homologies to chromosome targets are used to generate precise and accurate genetic modifications when introduced into bacteria expressing phage recombinases. Understanding the molecular mechanism of these recombination systems will facilitate improvements in the technology. Here, two phage-specific systems are shown to require exposure of complementary single-strand homologous targets for efficient recombination; these single-strand regions may be created during DNA replication or by single-strand exonuclease digestion of linear duplex DNA. Previously, in vitro studies reported that these recombinases promote the single-strand annealing of two complementary DNAs and also strand invasion of a single DNA strand into duplex DNA to create a three-stranded region. Here, in vivo experiments show that recombinase-mediated annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA is the predominant recombination pathway in E. coli."

The interaction of HPV E7 with retinoblastoma family proteins is important for several E7 activities; however, this interaction does not fully account for the high-risk E7-specific cellular immortalization and transformation activities. We have determined that the cellular non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14 interacts with HPV E7 from many genus alpha and beta HPV types. We find that high-risk genus alpha HPV E7, but not low-risk genus alpha or beta HPV E7, is necessary and sufficient to reduce the steady-state level of PTPN14 in cells. High-risk E7 proteins target PTPN14 for proteasome-mediated degradation, which requires the ubiquitin ligase UBR4, and PTPN14 is degraded by the proteasome in HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines. Residues in the C terminus of E7 interact with the C-terminal phosphatase domain of PTPN14, and interference with the E7-PTPN14 interaction restores PTPN14 levels in cells. Finally, PTPN14 degradation correlates with the retinoblastoma-independent transforming activity of high-risk HPV E7."

Since experiments concerning physiology or gene function are seldom replicated by others, i.e., in a different A. fumigatus background, the extent to which behavioral heterogeneity exists within the species is poorly understood. As a proxy for assessing such intraspecies variability, we analyzed the light response of 15 A. fumigatus isolates and observed striking quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity among them. The majority of the isolates fell into one of two seemingly mutually exclusive groups: (i) \"photopigmenters\" that robustly accumulate hyphal melanin in the light and (ii) \"photoconidiators\" that induce sporulation in the light. These two distinct responses were both governed by the same upstream blue light receptor, LreA, indicating that a specific protein's contribution can vary in a strain-dependent manner. Indeed, while LreA played no apparent role in regulating cell wall homeostasis in strain Af293, it was essential in that regard in strain CEA10. The manifest heterogeneity in the photoresponses led us to compare the virulence levels of selected isolates in a murine model; remarkably, the virulence did vary greatly, although not in a manner that correlated with their overt light response. Taken together, these data highlight the extent to which isolates of A. fumigatus can vary, with respect to both broad physiological characteristics (e.g., virulence and photoresponse) and specific protein functionality (e.g., LreA-dependent phenotypes)."

In a systematic assessment of 15 A. fumigatus isolates, we show that the species is highly heterogeneous with respect to its light response and virulence. Whereas some isolates accumulate pigments in light as previously reported with strain Af293, most induce sporulation which had not been previously observed. Other photoresponsive behaviors are also nonuniform, and phenotypes of identical gene deletants vary in a background-dependent manner. Moreover, the virulence of several selected isolates is highly variable in a mouse model and apparently does not track with any observed light response. Cumulatively, this work illuminates the fact that data obtained with a single A. fumigatus isolate are not necessarily predictive of the species as whole. Accordingly, researchers should be vigilant when making conclusions about their own work or when interpreting data from the literature."

Although their role in conferring multidrug resistance is well documented, the emergence of \"super\" efflux pump variants that enhance bacterial resistance to multiple drugs has not been reported. Here, we describe the emergence of a resistance-enhancing variant (named RE-CmeABC) of the predominant efflux pump CmeABC in Campylobacter, a major zoonotic pathogen whose resistance to antibiotics is considered a serious antibiotic resistance threat in the United States. Compared to the previously characterized CmeABC transporters, RE-CmeABC is much more potent in conferring Campylobacter resistance to antibiotics, which was shown by increased MICs and reduced intracellular accumulation of antibiotics. Structural modeling suggests that sequence variations in the drug-binding pocket of CmeB possibly contribute to the enhanced efflux function. Additionally, RE-CmeABC expands the mutant selection window of ciprofloxacin, enhances the emergence of antibiotic-resistant mutants, and confers exceedingly high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones, an important class of antibiotics for clinical therapy of campylobacteriosis. Furthermore, RE-CmeABC is horizontally transferable, shifts antibiotic MIC distribution among clinical isolates, and is increasingly prevalent in Campylobacter jejuni isolates, suggesting that it confers a fitness advantage under antimicrobial selection. These findings reveal a new mechanism for enhanced multidrug resistance and an effective strategy utilized by bacteria for adaptation to selection from multiple antibiotics."

Unlike other specific resistance determinants that only allow bacteria to resist a particular antimicrobial, the acquisition of a functionally enhanced efflux pump will empower bacteria with simultaneous resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics.

        "Abstract": [
            "Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections cause significant morbidity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Over years to decades, P. aeruginosa adapts genetically as it establishes chronic lung infections. Nonsynonymous mutations in lasR, the quorum-sensing (QS) master regulator, are common in CF. In laboratory strains of P. aeruginosa, LasR activates transcription of dozens of genes, including that for another QS regulator, RhlR. Despite the frequency with which lasR coding variants have been reported to occur in P. aeruginosa CF isolates, little is known about their consequences for QS. We sequenced lasR from 2,583 P. aeruginosa CF isolates. The lasR sequences of 580 isolates (22%) coded for polypeptides that differed from the conserved LasR polypeptides of well-studied laboratory strains. This collection included 173 unique lasR coding variants, 116 of which were either missense or nonsense mutations. We studied 31 of these variants. About one-sixth of the variant LasR proteins were functional, including 3 with nonsense mutations, and in some LasR-null isolates, genes that are LasR dependent in laboratory strains were nonetheless expressed. Furthermore, about half of the LasR-null isolates retained RhlR activity. Therefore, in some CF isolates the QS hierarchy is altered such that RhlR quorum sensing is independent of LasR regulation. Our analysis challenges the view that QS-silent P. aeruginosa is selected during the course of a chronic CF lung infection. Rather, some lasR sequence variants retain functionality, and many employ an alternate QS strategy involving RhlR.",

                "#text": "Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, such as those in patients with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, are notable in that mutants with defects in the quorum-sensing transcription factor LasR frequently arise. In laboratory strains of P. aeruginosa, quorum sensing activates transcription of dozens of genes, many of which encode virulence factors, such as secreted proteases and hydrogen cyanide synthases. In well-studied laboratory strains, LasR-null mutants have a quorum-sensing-deficient phenotype. Therefore, the presence of LasR variants in chronic infections has been interpreted to indicate that quorum-sensing-regulated products are not important for those infections. We report that some P. aeruginosa LasR variant clinical isolates are not LasR-null mutants, and others have uncoupled a second quorum-sensing system, the RhlR system, from LasR regulation. In these uncoupled isolates, RhlR independently activates at least some quorum-sensing-dependent genes. Our findings suggest that quorum sensing plays a role in chronic P. aeruginosa infections, despite the emergence of LasR coding variants."

        "Abstract": [
            "The diploid genome of the yeast Candida albicans is highly plastic, exhibiting frequent loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. To provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms leading to LOH, we investigated the repair of a unique DNA double-strand break (DSB) in the laboratory C. albicans SC5314 strain using the I-SceI meganuclease. Upon I-SceI induction, we detected a strong increase in the frequency of LOH events at an I-SceI target locus positioned on chromosome 4 (Chr4), including events spreading from this locus to the proximal telomere. Characterization of the repair events by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing and whole-genome sequencing revealed a predominance of gene conversions, but we also observed mitotic crossover or break-induced replication events, as well as combinations of independent events. Importantly, progeny that had undergone homozygosis of part or all of Chr4 haplotype B (Chr4B) were inviable. Mining of genome sequencing data for 155 C. albicans isolates allowed the identification of a recessive lethal allele in the GPI16 gene on Chr4B unique to C. albicans strain SC5314 which is responsible for this inviability. Additional recessive lethal or deleterious alleles were identified in the genomes of strain SC5314 and two clinical isolates. Our results demonstrate that recessive lethal alleles in the genomes of C. albicans isolates prevent the occurrence of specific extended LOH events. While these and other recessive lethal and deleterious alleles are likely to accumulate in C. albicans due to clonal reproduction, their occurrence may in turn promote the maintenance of corresponding nondeleterious alleles and, consequently, heterozygosity in the C. albicans species.",

Accumulation of recessive deleterious mutations upon clonal reproduction of C. albicans could contribute to the maintenance of heterozygosity despite the high frequency of LOH events in this species."

            "Biofilm-associated polymicrobial infections, particularly those involving fungi and bacteria, are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality and tend to be challenging to treat. Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus specifically are considered leading opportunistic fungal and bacterial pathogens, respectively, mainly due to their ability to form biofilms on catheters and indwelling medical devices. However, the impact of mixed-species biofilm growth on therapy remains largely understudied. In this study, we investigated the influence of C. albicans secreted cell wall polysaccharides on the response of S. aureus to antibacterial agents in biofilm. Results demonstrated significantly enhanced tolerance for S. aureus to drugs in the presence of C. albicans or its secreted cell wall polysaccharide material. Fluorescence confocal time-lapse microscopy revealed impairment of drug diffusion through the mixed biofilm matrix. Using C. albicans mutant strains with modulated cell wall polysaccharide expression, exogenous supplementation, and enzymatic degradation, the C. albicans-secreted β-1,3-glucan cell wall component was identified as the key matrix constituent providing the bacteria with enhanced drug tolerance. Further, antibody labeling demonstrated rapid coating of the bacteria by the C. albicans matrix material. Importantly, via its effect on the fungal biofilm matrix, the antifungal caspofungin sensitized the bacteria to the drugs. Understanding such symbiotic interactions with clinical relevance between microbial species in biofilms will greatly aid in overcoming the limitations of current therapies and in defining potential new targets for treating polymicrobial infections.",

The biofilm matrix formed by these polysaccharides prevented penetration by the drugs and provided the bacteria with protection. Importantly, we show that by inhibiting the production of the fungal polysaccharides, a specific antifungal agent indirectly sensitized the bacteria to antimicrobials.

        "Abstract": "The property of transposons to randomly insert into target DNA has long been exploited for generalized mutagenesis and forward genetic screens. Newer applications that monitor the relative abundance of each transposon insertion in large libraries of mutants can be used to evaluate the roles in cellular fitness of all genes of an organism, provided that transposition is in fact random across all genes. In a recent article, Kimura and colleagues identified an important exception to the latter assumption [S. Kimura, T. P. Hubbard, B. M. Davis, M. K. Waldor, mBio 7(4):e01351-16, 2016, doi:10.1128/mBio.01351-16]. They provide evidence that the Mariner transposon exhibits locus-specific site preferences in the presence of the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein H-NS. This effect was shown to bias results for important virulence loci in Vibrio cholerae and to result in misidentification of genes involved in growth in vitro Fortunately, the bulk of this bacterium's genome was unaffected by this bias, and recognizing the H-NS effect allows filtering to improve the accuracy of the results.",

        "Abstract": [
            "Iron is an essential micronutrient for both pathogens and their hosts, which restrict iron availability during infections in an effort to prevent microbial growth. Successful human pathogens like the yeast Candida glabrata have thus developed effective iron acquisition strategies. Their regulation has been investigated well for some pathogenic fungi and in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which employs an evolutionarily derived system. Here, we show that C. glabrata uses a regulation network largely consisting of components of the S. cerevisiae regulon but also of elements of other pathogenic fungi. Specifically, similarly to baker's yeast, Aft1 is the main positive regulator under iron starvation conditions, while Cth2 degrades mRNAs encoding iron-requiring enzymes. However, unlike the case with S. cerevisiae, a Sef1 ortholog is required for full growth under iron limitation conditions, making C. glabrata an evolutionary intermediate to SEF1-dependent fungal pathogens. Therefore, C. glabrata has evolved an iron homeostasis system which seems to be unique within the pathogenic fungi.",

Importantly, S. cerevisiae uses a highly derivative regulatory system distinct from those of other fungi. Until now, the regulatory mechanism of iron homeostasis in C. glabrata has been mostly unknown. Our study revealed a hybrid iron regulation network that is unique to C. glabrata and is placed at an evolutionary midpoint between those of S. cerevisiae and related fungal pathogens. We thereby show that, in the host, even a successful human pathogen can rely largely on a strategy normally found in nonpathogenic fungi from a terrestrial environment."

        "Abstract": [
            "YbeY is part of a core set of RNases in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. This highly conserved endoribonuclease has been implicated in several important processes such as 16S rRNA 3' end maturation, 70S ribosome quality control, and regulation of mRNAs and small noncoding RNAs, thereby affecting cellular viability, stress tolerance, and pathogenic and symbiotic behavior of bacteria. Thus, YbeY likely interacts with numerous protein or RNA partners that are involved in various aspects of cellular physiology. Using a bacterial two-hybrid system, we identified several proteins that interact with YbeY, including ribosomal protein S11, the ribosome-associated GTPases Era and Der, YbeZ, and SpoT. In particular, the interaction of YbeY with S11 and Era provides insight into YbeY's involvement in the 16S rRNA maturation process. The three-way association between YbeY, S11, and Era suggests that YbeY is recruited to the ribosome where it could cleave the 17S rRNA precursor endonucleolytically at or near the 3' end maturation site. Analysis of YbeY missense mutants shows that a highly conserved beta-sheet in YbeY-and not amino acids known to be important for YbeY's RNase activity-functions as the interface between YbeY and S11. This protein-interacting interface of YbeY is needed for correct rRNA maturation and stress regulation, as missense mutants show significant phenotypic defects. Additionally, structure-based in silico prediction of putative interactions between YbeY and the Era-30S complex through protein docking agrees well with the in vivo results.",

Their assembly is a highly coordinated process of RNA cleavage, RNA posttranscriptional modification, RNA conformational changes, and protein-binding events. Many open questions remain after almost 5 decades of study, including which RNase is responsible for final processing of the 16S rRNA 3' end. The highly conserved RNase YbeY, belonging to a core set of RNases essential in many bacteria, was previously shown to participate in 16S rRNA processing and ribosome quality control. However, detailed mechanistic insight into YbeY's ribosome-associated function has remained elusive. This work provides the first evidence that YbeY is recruited to the ribosome through interaction with proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis (i.e., ribosomal protein S11, Era). In addition, we identified key residues of YbeY involved in the interaction with S11 and propose a possible binding mode of YbeY to the ribosome using in silico docking."

            "Eukaryotic chromosomal ends are protected by telomeres from fusion, degradation, and unwanted double-strand break repair events. Therefore, telomeres preserve genome stability and integrity. Telomere length can be maintained by telomerase, which is expressed in most human primary tumors but is not expressed in the majority of somatic cells. Thus, telomerase may be a highly relevant anticancer drug target. Genome-wide studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified a set of genes associated with telomere length maintenance (TLM genes). Among the tlm mutants with short telomeres, we found a strong enrichment for those affecting vacuolar and endosomal traffic (particularly the endosomal sorting complex required for transport [ESCRT] pathway). Here, we present our results from investigating the surprising link between telomere shortening and the ESCRT machinery. Our data show that the whole ESCRT system is required to safeguard proper telomere length maintenance. We propose a model of impaired end resection resulting in too little telomeric overhang, such that Cdc13 binding is prevented, precluding either telomerase recruitment or telomeric overhang protection.",

We carried out an analysis of the mechanisms disrupted in these mutants and found that they are defective for the ability to elongate short telomeres, probably due to faulty end processing. We discuss the significance of these findings and how they could be relevant to anticancer therapies."

        "Abstract": [
            "The white-opaque switch is a bistable, epigenetic transition affecting multiple traits in Candida albicans including mating, immunogenicity, and niche specificity. To compare how the two cell states respond to external cues, we examined the fitness, phenotypic switching, and filamentation properties of white cells and opaque cells under 1,440 different conditions at 25°C and 37°C. We demonstrate that white and opaque cells display striking differences in their integration of metabolic and thermal cues, so that the two states exhibit optimal fitness under distinct conditions. White cells were fitter than opaque cells under a wide range of environmental conditions, including growth at various pHs and in the presence of chemical stresses or antifungal drugs. This difference was exacerbated at 37°C, consistent with white cells being the default state of C. albicans in the mammalian host. In contrast, opaque cells showed greater fitness than white cells under select nutritional conditions, including growth on diverse peptides at 25°C. We further demonstrate that filamentation is significantly rewired between the two states, with white and opaque cells undergoing filamentous growth in response to distinct external cues. Genetic analysis was used to identify signaling pathways impacting the white-opaque transition both in vitro and in a murine model of commensal colonization, and three sugar sensing pathways are revealed as regulators of the switch. Together, these findings establish that white and opaque cells are programmed for differential integration of metabolic and thermal cues and that opaque cells represent a more metabolically specialized cell state than the default white state.",

Here, we demonstrate that metabolic circuits are extensively rewired between white and opaque states, so that the two cell types exhibit optimal fitness under different nutritional conditions and at different temperatures. We thereby establish that epigenetic events can profoundly alter the metabolism of fungal cells. We also demonstrate that epigenetic switching regulates filamentation and biofilm formation, two phenotypes closely associated with pathogenesis.

            "Conventional efforts to describe essential genes in bacteria have typically emphasized nutrient-rich growth conditions. Of note, however, are the set of genes that become essential when bacteria are grown under nutrient stress. For example, more than 100 genes become indispensable when the model bacterium Escherichia coli is grown on nutrient-limited media, and many of these nutrient stress genes have also been shown to be important for the growth of various bacterial pathogens in vivo To better understand the genetic network that underpins nutrient stress in E. coli, we performed a genome-scale cross of strains harboring deletions in some 82 nutrient stress genes with the entire E. coli gene deletion collection (Keio) to create 315,400 double deletion mutants. An analysis of the growth of the resulting strains on rich microbiological media revealed an average of 23 synthetic sick or lethal genetic interactions for each nutrient stress gene, suggesting that the network defining nutrient stress is surprisingly complex. A vast majority of these interactions involved genes of unknown function or genes of unrelated pathways. The most profound synthetic lethal interactions were between nutrient acquisition and biosynthesis. Further, the interaction map reveals remarkable metabolic robustness in E. coli through pathway redundancies. In all, the genetic interaction network provides a powerful tool to mine and identify missing links in nutrient synthesis and to further characterize genes of unknown function in E. coli Moreover, understanding of bacterial growth under nutrient stress could aid in the development of novel antibiotic discovery platforms.",

Here, we studied a group of genes that are essential for the growth of Escherichia coli under nutrient limitation, culture conditions that arguably better represent nutrient availability during an infection than rich microbiological media. Indeed, many such nutrient stress genes are essential for infection in a variety of pathogens. Thus, the respective proteins represent a pool of potential new targets for antibacterial drugs that have been largely unexplored. We have created all possible double deletion mutants through a genetic cross of nutrient stress genes and the E. coli deletion collection. An analysis of the growth of the resulting clones on rich media revealed a robust, dense, and complex network for nutrient acquisition and biosynthesis. Importantly, our data reveal new genetic connections to guide innovative approaches for the development of new antibacterial compounds targeting bacteria under nutrient stress."

        "Abstract": [
            "Melanins are biopolymers that confer coloration and protection to the host organism against biotic or abiotic insults. The level of protection offered by melanin depends on its biosynthesis and its subcellular localization. Previously, we discovered that Aspergillus fumigatus compartmentalizes melanization in endosomes by recruiting all melanin enzymes to the secretory pathway. Surprisingly, although two laccases involved in the late steps of melanization are conventional secretory proteins, the four enzymes involved in the early steps of melanization lack a signal peptide or a transmembrane domain and are thus considered \"atypical\" secretory proteins. In this work, we found interactions among melanin enzymes and all melanin enzymes formed protein complexes. Surprisingly, the formation of protein complexes by melanin enzymes was not critical for their trafficking to the endosomal system. By palmitoylation profiling and biochemical analyses, we discovered that all four early melanin enzymes were strongly palmitoylated during conidiation. However, only the polyketide synthase (PKS) Alb1 was strongly palmitoylated during both vegetative hyphal growth and conidiation when constitutively expressed alone. This posttranslational lipid modification correlates the endosomal localization of all early melanin enzymes. Intriguingly, bioinformatic analyses predict that palmitoylation is a common mechanism for potential membrane association of polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) in A. fumigatus Our findings indicate that protein-protein interactions facilitate melanization by metabolic channeling, while posttranslational lipid modifications help recruit the atypical enzymes to the secretory pathway, which is critical for compartmentalization of secondary metabolism.",

It facilitates sequential enzymatic reactions, provides mobility for enzymes and metabolites, and offers protection against self-toxification.

Through studying melanization in Aspergillus, we previously found that all enzymes involved in the early steps of melanization are atypical secretory proteins. Here, we discovered physical interactions among melanin enzymes. However, it was the posttranslational palmitoylation rather than the physical interaction that was responsible for their recruitment to the secretory pathway.

        "Abstract": "The basidiomycetous fungus Cryptococcus neoformans has been known to be highly radiation resistant and has been found in fatal radioactive environments such as the damaged nuclear reactor at Chernobyl. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the radiation resistance phenotype of C. neoformans, we identified genes affected by gamma radiation through genome-wide transcriptome analysis and characterized their functions. We found that genes involved in DNA damage repair systems were upregulated in response to gamma radiation. Particularly, deletion of recombinase RAD51 and two DNA-dependent ATPase genes, RAD54 and RDH54, increased cellular susceptibility to both gamma radiation and DNA-damaging agents. A variety of oxidative stress response genes were also upregulated. Among them, sulfiredoxin contributed to gamma radiation resistance in a peroxiredoxin/thioredoxin-independent manner. Furthermore, we found that genes involved in molecular chaperone expression, ubiquitination systems, and autophagy were induced, whereas genes involved in the biosynthesis of proteins and fatty acids/sterols were downregulated. Most importantly, we discovered a number of novel C. neoformans genes, the expression of which was modulated by gamma radiation exposure, and their deletion rendered cells susceptible to gamma radiation exposure, as well as DNA damage insults. Among these genes, we found that a unique transcription factor containing the basic leucine zipper domain, named Bdr1, served as a regulator of the gamma radiation resistance of C. neoformans by controlling expression of DNA repair genes, and its expression was regulated by the evolutionarily conserved DNA damage response protein kinase Rad53. Taken together, the current transcriptome and functional analyses contribute to the understanding of the unique molecular mechanism of the radiation-resistant fungus C. neoformans IMPORTANCE: Although there are no natural environments under intense radiation, some living organisms have been found to show high radiation resistance. Organisms harboring the ability of radiation resistance have unique regulatory networks to overcome this stress. Cryptococcus neoformans is one of the radiation-resistant fungi and is found in highly radioactive environments. However, it remains elusive how radiation-resistant eukaryotic microorganisms work differentially from radiation-sensitive ones. Here, we performed transcriptome analysis of C. neoformans to explore gene expression profiles after gamma radiation exposure and functionally characterized some of identified radiation resistance genes. Notably, we identified a novel regulator of radiation resistance, named Bdr1 (a bZIP TF for DNA damage response 1), which is a transcription factor (TF) that is not closely homologous to any known TF and is transcriptionally controlled by the Rad53 kinase. Therefore, our work could shed light on understanding not only the radiation response but also the radiation resistance mechanism of C. neoformans.",

        "Abstract": [
            "Brucella abortus, the bacterial agent of the worldwide zoonosis brucellosis, primarily infects host phagocytes, where it undergoes an intracellular cycle within a dedicated membrane-bound vacuole, the Brucella-containing vacuole (BCV). Initially of endosomal origin (eBCV), BCVs are remodeled into replication-permissive organelles (rBCV) derived from the host endoplasmic reticulum, a process that requires modulation of host secretory functions via delivery of effector proteins by the Brucella VirB type IV secretion system (T4SS). Following replication, rBCVs are converted into autophagic vacuoles (aBCVs) that facilitate bacterial egress and subsequent infections, arguing that the bacterium sequentially manipulates multiple cellular pathways to complete its cycle. The VirB T4SS is essential for rBCV biogenesis, as VirB-deficient mutants are stalled in eBCVs and cannot mediate rBCV biogenesis. This has precluded analysis of whether the VirB apparatus also drives subsequent stages of the Brucella intracellular cycle. To address this issue, we have generated a B. abortus strain in which VirB T4SS function is conditionally controlled via anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-dependent complementation of a deletion of the virB11 gene encoding the VirB11 ATPase. We show in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) that early VirB production is essential for optimal rBCV biogenesis and bacterial replication. Transient expression of virB11 prior to infection was sufficient to mediate normal rBCV biogenesis and bacterial replication but led to T4SS inactivation and decreased aBCV formation and bacterial release, indicating that these postreplication stages are also T4SS dependent. Hence, our findings support the hypothesis of additional, postreplication roles of type IV secretion in the Brucella intracellular cycle.",

Because these intracellular events occur sequentially, classical genetic approaches cannot address the late roles that these apparatuses play, as secretion-deficient mutants cannot proceed past their initial defect. Here we have designed a functionally controllable VirB type IV secretion system (T4SS) in the bacterial pathogen Brucella abortus to decipher its temporal requirements during the bacterium's intracellular cycle in macrophages. By controlling production of the VirB11 ATPase, which energizes the T4SS, we show not only that this apparatus is required early to generate the Brucella replicative organelle but also that it contributes to completion of the bacterium's cycle and bacterial egress. Our findings expand upon the pathogenic functions of the Brucella VirB T4SS and illustrate targeting of secretion ATPases as a useful strategy to manipulate the activity of bacterial secretion systems."

Recent genome sequencing projects have defined the gene content of all 14 species; however, to date, genetic manipulation has not been possible for any species within this genus. Here, we develop and then optimize molecular tools for the transformation of Malassezia furfur and Malassezia sympodialis using Agrobacterium tumefaciens delivery of transfer DNA (T-DNA) molecules. These T-DNAs can insert randomly into the genome. In the case of M. furfur, targeted gene replacements were also achieved via homologous recombination, enabling deletion of the ADE2 gene for purine biosynthesis and of the LAC2 gene predicted to be involved in melanin biosynthesis. Hence, the introduction of exogenous DNA and direct gene manipulation are feasible in Malassezia species.",

In this study, we pursued a series of possible transformation methods and identified one that allows the introduction of DNA into two species of Malassezia, including the ability to make targeted integrations into the genome such that genes can be deleted. This research opens a new direction in terms of now being able to analyze gene functions in this little understood genus. These tools will contribute to define the mechanisms that lead to the commensalism and pathogenicity in this group of obligate fungi that are predominant on the skin of mammals."

        "Abstract": [
            "Quorum sensing (QS) is a microbial cell-cell communication system that regulates gene expression in response to population density to coordinate collective behaviors. Yet, the role of QS in resolving the stresses caused by the accumulation of toxic metabolic by-products at high cell density is not well defined. In response to cell density, QS could be involved in reprogramming of the metabolic network to maintain population stability. Using unbiased metabolomics, we discovered that Vibrio cholerae mutants genetically locked in a low cell density (LCD) QS state are unable to alter the pyruvate flux to convert fermentable carbon sources into neutral acetoin and 2,3-butanediol molecules to offset organic acid production. As a consequence, LCD-locked QS mutants rapidly lose viability when grown with fermentable carbon sources. This key metabolic switch relies on the QS-regulated small RNAs Qrr1-4 but is independent of known QS regulators AphA and HapR. Qrr1-4 dictate pyruvate flux by translational repression of the enzyme AlsS, which carries out the first step in acetoin and 2,3-butanediol biosynthesis. Consistent with the idea that QS facilitates the expression of a common trait in the population, AlsS needs to be expressed cooperatively in a group of cells. Heterogeneous populations with high percentages of cells not expressing AlsS are unstable. All of the cells, regardless of their respective QS states, succumb to stresses caused by toxic by-product accumulation. Our results indicate that the ability of the bacteria to cooperatively control metabolic flux through QS is critical in maintaining a sustainable environment and overall population stability.",

QS enables V. cholerae switching from a low cell density energy-generating metabolism that is beneficial to individuals at the expense of the environment to a high cell density mode that preserves environmental habitability by sacrificing individual fitness. This cooperative switch provides a stable environment as the common good in maintaining the stability of the community. However, the common good can be exploited by uncooperative mutants that pollute the environment, causing population collapse. Our findings provide insights into the metabolic stress response of a major human pathogen, with implications for our understanding of microbial social biology and cooperation from an ecological and evolutionary perspective."

To date, investigations into Tfp retraction-dependent activities have used a mutant deleted of PilT, the ATPase motor protein that causes the pilus fiber to retract. ΔpilT cells are nontransformable, nonmotile, and cannot aggregate into microcolonies. We tested the hypothesis that these retraction-dependent activities are sensitive to the strength of PilT enzymatic activity by using the pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae as a model. We constructed an N. gonorrhoeae mutant with an amino acid substitution in the PilT Walker B box (a substitution of cysteine for leucine at position 201, encoded by pilT). Purified PilT forms a native hexamer, but mutant hexamers hydrolyze ATP at half the maximal rate. N. gonorrhoeae pilT cells produce Tfp fibers, crawl at the same speed as the wild-type (wt) parent, and are equally transformable. However, the social behavior of pilT cells is intermediate between the behaviors of wt and ΔpilT cells. The infection behavior of pilT is also defective, due to its failure to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) pathway. Our study indicates that pilus retraction, per se, is not sufficient for N. gonorrhoeae microcolony formation or infectivity; rather, these activities are sensitive to the strength of PilT enzymatic activity. We discuss the implications of these findings for Neisseria pathogenesis in the context of mechanobiology."

These quasi-enveloped virions (eHAV) are the only particle type circulating in blood during infection, whereas only nonenveloped virions are shed in feces. The reason for this is uncertain. Hepatocytes, the only cell type known to support HAV replication in vivo, are highly polarized epithelial cells with basolateral membranes facing onto hepatic (blood) sinusoids and apical membranes abutting biliary canaliculi from which bile is secreted to the gut. To assess whether eHAV and nonenveloped virus egress from cells via vectorially distinct pathways, we studied infected polarized cultures of Caco-2 and HepG2-N6 cells. Most (>99%) progeny virions were released apically from Caco-2 cells, whereas basolateral (64%) versus apical (36%) release was more balanced with HepG2-N6 cells. Both apically and basolaterally released virions were predominantly enveloped, with no suggestion of differential vectorial release of eHAV versus naked virions. Basolateral to apical transcytosis of either particle type was minimal (<0.02%/h) in HepG2-N6 cells, arguing against this as a mechanism for differences in membrane envelopment of serum versus fecal virus. High concentrations of human bile acids converted eHAV to nonenveloped virions, whereas virus present in bile from HAV-infected Ifnar1 Ifngr1 and Mavs mice banded over a range of densities extending from that of eHAV to that of nonenveloped virions. We conclude that nonenveloped virions shed in feces are derived from eHAV released across the canalicular membrane and stripped of membranes by the detergent action of bile acids within the proximal biliary canaliculus."

Virus is found in cell culture supernatant fluids in two mature, infectious forms: one wrapped in membranes (quasi-enveloped) and another that is nonenveloped. Membrane-wrapped virions circulate in blood during acute infection and are resistant to neutralizing antibodies, likely facilitating HAV dissemination within the liver. On the other hand, virus shed in feces is nonenveloped and highly stable, facilitating epidemic spread and transmission to naive hosts. Factors controlling the biogenesis of these two distinct forms of the virus in infected humans are not understood. Here we characterize vectorial release of quasi-enveloped virions from polarized epithelial cell cultures and provide evidence that bile acids strip membranes from eHAV following its secretion into the biliary tract. These results enhance our understanding of the life cycle of this unusual picornavirus."

        "Abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of bacterially derived gastroenteritis. A previous mutant screen demonstrated that the heme uptake system (Chu) is required for full colonization of the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Subsequent work identified a PAS domain-containing regulator, termed HeuR, as being required for chicken colonization. Here we confirm that both the heme uptake system and HeuR are required for full chicken gastrointestinal tract colonization, with the heuR mutant being particularly affected during competition with wild-type C. jejuni Transcriptomic analysis identified the chu genes-and those encoding other iron uptake systems-as regulatory targets of HeuR. Purified HeuR bound the chuZA promoter region in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Consistent with a role for HeuR in chu expression, heuR mutants were unable to efficiently use heme as a source of iron under iron-limiting conditions, and mutants exhibited decreased levels of cell-associated iron by mass spectrometry. Finally, we demonstrate that an heuR mutant of C. jejuni is resistant to hydrogen peroxide and that this resistance correlates to elevated levels of catalase activity. These results indicate that HeuR directly and positively regulates iron acquisition from heme and negatively impacts catalase activity by an as yet unidentified mechanism in C. jejuni IMPORTANCE: Annually, Campylobacter jejuni causes millions of gastrointestinal infections in the United States, due primarily to its ability to reside within the gastrointestinal tracts of poultry, where it can be released during processing and contaminate meat. In the developing world, humans are often infected by consuming contaminated water or by direct contact with livestock. Following consumption of contaminated food or water, humans develop disease that is characterized by mild to severe diarrhea. There is a need to understand both colonization of chickens, to make food safer, and colonization of humans, to better understand disease. Here we demonstrate that to efficiently colonize a host, C. jejuni requires iron from heme, which is regulated by the protein HeuR. Understanding how HeuR functions, we can develop ways to inhibit its function and reduce iron acquisition during colonization, potentially reducing C. jejuni in the avian host, which would make food safer, or limiting human colonization.",

            "Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) binds to claudin receptors, e.g., claudin-4, and then forms a pore that triggers cell death. Pure cultures of host cells that do not express claudin receptors, e.g., fibroblasts, are unaffected by pathophysiologically relevant CPE concentrations in vitro However, both CPE-insensitive and CPE-sensitive host cells are present in vivo Therefore, this study tested whether CPE treatment might affect fibroblasts when cocultured with CPE-sensitive claudin-4 fibroblast transfectants or Caco-2 cells. Under these conditions, immunofluorescence microscopy detected increased death of fibroblasts. This cytotoxic effect involved release of a toxic factor from the dying CPE-sensitive cells, since it could be reproduced using culture supernatants from CPE-treated sensitive cells. Supernatants from CPE-treated sensitive cells, particularly Caco-2 cells, were found to contain high levels of membrane vesicles, often containing a CPE species. However, most cytotoxic activity remained in those supernatants even after membrane vesicle depletion, and CPE was not detected in fibroblasts treated with supernatants from CPE-treated sensitive cells. Instead, characterization studies suggest that a major cytotoxic factor present in supernatants from CPE-treated sensitive cells may be a 10- to 30-kDa host serine protease or require the action of that host serine protease. Induction of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis was found to be important for triggering release of the cytotoxic factor(s) from CPE-treated sensitive host cells. Furthermore, the cytotoxic factor(s) in these supernatants was shown to induce a caspase-3-mediated killing of fibroblasts. This bystander killing effect due to release of cytotoxic factors from CPE-treated sensitive cells could contribute to CPE-mediated disease.",

These findings suggest a novel bystander killing mechanism by which a pore-forming toxin may extend its damage to affect cells not directly responsive to that toxin. If confirmed to occur in vivo by future studies, this bystander killing effect may have significance during CPE-mediated disease and could impact the translational use of CPE for purposes such as cancer therapy."

            "Motile bacteria use large receptor arrays to detect and follow chemical gradients in their environment. Extended receptor arrays, composed of networked signaling complexes, promote cooperative stimulus control of their associated signaling kinases. Here, we used structural lesions at the communication interface between core complexes to create an Escherichia coli strain with functional but dispersed signaling complexes. This strain allowed us to directly study how networking of signaling complexes affects chemotactic signaling and gradient-tracking performance. We demonstrate that networking of receptor complexes provides bacterial cells with about 10-fold-heightened detection sensitivity to attractants while maintaining a wide dynamic range over which receptor adaptational modifications can tune response sensitivity. These advantages proved especially critical for chemotaxis toward an attractant source under conditions in which bacteria are unable to alter the attractant gradient.",

            "The Gram-positive bacterial cell wall (CW) peptidoglycan-teichoic acid complex is released into the host environment during bacterial metabolism or death. It is a highly inflammatory Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligand, and previous in vivo studies have demonstrated its ability to recapitulate pathological features of pneumonia and meningitis. We report that an actin-dependent pathway is involved in the internalization of the CW by epithelial and endothelial cells, in addition to the previously described platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFr)-dependent uptake pathway. Unlike the PAFr-dependent pathway, which is mediated by clathrin and dynamin and does not lead to signaling, the alternative pathway is sensitive to 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) and engenders Rac1, Cdc42, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Upon internalization by this macropinocytosis-like pathway, CW is trafficked to lysosomes. Intracellular CW trafficking is more complex than previously recognized and suggests multiple points of interaction with and without innate immune signaling.",

In the present study, by using cells that are depleted of PAFr, we identified a second pathway with features of macropinocytosis, which is a receptor-independent fluid uptake mechanism by cells. Each pathway contributes approximately the same amount of cell wall trafficking, but the PAFr pathway is silent, while the new pathway appears to contribute to the host inflammatory response to CW insult."

However, even though phage-plasmid interactions occur on a massive scale and have potentially significant evolutionary, ecological, and biomedical implications, plasmid fate upon phage infection and lysis has not been investigated to date. Here we show that a subset of the natural lytic phage population, which we dub \"superspreaders,\" releases substantial amounts of intact, transformable plasmid DNA upon lysis, thereby promoting horizontal gene transfer by transformation. Two novel Escherichia coli phage superspreaders, SUSP1 and SUSP2, liberated four evolutionarily distinct plasmids with equal efficiency, including two close relatives of prominent antibiotic resistance vectors in natural environments. SUSP2 also mediated the extensive lateral transfer of antibiotic resistance in unbiased communities of soil bacteria from Maryland and Wyoming. Furthermore, the addition of SUSP2 to cocultures of kanamycin-resistant E. coli and kanamycin-sensitive Bacillus sp. bacteria resulted in roughly 1,000-fold more kanamycin-resistant Bacillus sp. bacteria than arose in phage-free controls. Unlike many other lytic phages, neither SUSP1 nor SUSP2 encodes homologs to known hydrolytic endonucleases, suggesting a simple potential mechanism underlying the superspreading phenotype. Consistent with this model, the deletion of endonuclease IV and the nucleoid-disrupting protein ndd from coliphage T4, a phage known to extensively degrade chromosomal DNA, significantly increased its ability to promote plasmid transformation. Taken together, our results suggest that phage superspreaders may play key roles in microbial evolution and ecology but should be avoided in phage therapy and other medical applications."

Many of these bacteria carry plasmids, extrachromosomal DNA elements that frequently encode antibiotic resistance. However, it is largely unknown whether plasmids are destroyed during phage infection or released intact upon phage lysis, whereupon their encoded resistance could be acquired and manifested by other bacteria (transformation). Because phages are being developed to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria and because transformation is a principal form of horizontal gene transfer, this question has important implications for biomedicine and microbial evolution alike. Here we report the isolation and characterization of two novel Escherichia coli phages, dubbed \"superspreaders,\" that promote extensive plasmid transformation and efficiently disperse antibiotic resistance genes. Our work suggests that phage superspreaders are not suitable for use in medicine but may help drive bacterial evolution in natural environments."

        "Abstract": [
            "The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a principal virulence determinant of the model bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae T3SS effector proteins inhibit plant defense signaling pathways in susceptible hosts and elicit evolved immunity in resistant plants. The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor HrpL coordinates the expression of most T3SS genes. Transcription of hrpL is dependent on sigma-54 and the codependent enhancer binding proteins HrpR and HrpS for hrpL promoter activation. hrpL is oriented adjacently to and divergently from the HrpL-dependent gene hrpJ, sharing an intergenic upstream regulatory region. We show that association of the RNA polymerase (RNAP)-HrpL complex with the hrpJ promoter element imposes negative autogenous control on hrpL transcription in P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. The hrpL promoter was upregulated in a ΔhrpL mutant and was repressed by plasmid-borne hrpL In a minimal Escherichia coli background, the activity of HrpL was sufficient to achieve repression of reconstituted hrpL transcription. This repression was relieved if both the HrpL DNA-binding function and the hrp-box sequence of the hrpJ promoter were compromised, implying dependence upon the hrpJ promoter. DNA-bound RNAP-HrpL entirely occluded the HrpRS and partially occluded the integration host factor (IHF) recognition elements of the hrpL promoter in vitro, implicating inhibition of DNA binding by these factors as a cause of negative autogenous control. A modest increase in the HrpL concentration caused hypersecretion of the HrpA1 pilus protein but intracellular accumulation of later T3SS substrates. We argue that negative feedback on HrpL activity fine-tunes expression of the T3SS regulon to minimize the elicitation of plant defenses.",

However, diseases caused by microbial pathogens represent a major threat to food security, accounting for over 10% of estimated yield losses in staple wheat, rice, and maize crops. Understanding the decision-making strategies employed by pathogens to coordinate virulence and to evade plant defenses is vital for informing crop resistance traits and management strategies. Many plant-pathogenic bacteria utilize the needle-like T3SS to inject virulence factors into host plant cells to suppress defense signaling. Pseudomonas syringae is an economically and environmentally devastating plant pathogen. We propose that the master regulator of its entire T3SS gene set, HrpL, downregulates its own expression to minimize elicitation of plant defenses. Revealing such conserved regulatory strategies will inform future antivirulence strategies targeting plant pathogens."

            "Type IVa pili (T4aP) are ubiquitous microbial appendages used for adherence, twitching motility, DNA uptake, and electron transfer. Many of these functions depend on dynamic assembly and disassembly of the pilus by a megadalton-sized, cell envelope-spanning protein complex located at the poles of rod-shaped bacteria. How the T4aP assembly complex becomes integrated into the cell envelope in the absence of dedicated peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases is unknown. After ruling out the potential involvement of housekeeping PG hydrolases in the installation of the T4aP machinery in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we discovered that key components of inner (PilMNOP) and outer (PilQ) membrane subcomplexes are recruited to future sites of cell division. Midcell recruitment of a fluorescently tagged alignment subcomplex component, mCherry-PilO, depended on PilQ secretin monomers-specifically, their N-terminal PG-binding AMIN domains. PilP, which connects PilO to PilQ, was required for recruitment, while PilM, which is structurally similar to divisome component FtsA, was not. Recruitment preceded secretin oligomerization in the outer membrane, as loss of the PilQ pilotin PilF had no effect on localization. These results were confirmed in cells chemically blocked for cell division prior to outer membrane invagination. The hub protein FimV and a component of the polar organelle coordinator complex-PocA-were independently required for midcell recruitment of PilO and PilQ. Together, these data suggest an integrated, energy-efficient strategy for the targeting and preinstallation-rather than retrofitting-of the T4aP system into nascent poles, without the need for dedicated PG-remodeling enzymes.",

Many systems include dedicated PG hydrolase components that create space for their insertion, but the ubiquitous type IVa pilus (T4aP) system lacks such an enzyme. Instead, we found that components of the T4aP system are recruited to future sites of cell division, where they could be incorporated into the cell envelope during the formation of new poles, eliminating the need for PG hydrolases. Targeting depends on the presence of septal PG-binding motifs in specific components, as removal of those motifs causes delocalization. This preinstallation strategy for the T4aP assembly system would ensure that both daughter cells are poised to extrude pili from new poles as soon as they separate from one another."

        "Abstract": [
            "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the central nervous system (CNS) by restricting the passage of molecules and microorganisms. Despite this barrier, however, the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans invades the brain, causing a meningoencephalitis that is estimated to kill over 600,000 people annually. Cryptococcal infection begins in the lung, and experimental evidence suggests that host phagocytes play a role in subsequent dissemination, although this role remains ill defined. Additionally, the disparate experimental approaches that have been used to probe various potential routes of BBB transit make it impossible to assess their relative contributions, confounding any integrated understanding of cryptococcal brain entry. Here we used an in vitro model BBB to show that a \"Trojan horse\" mechanism contributes significantly to fungal barrier crossing and that host factors regulate this process independently of free fungal transit. We also, for the first time, directly imaged C. neoformans-containing phagocytes crossing the BBB, showing that they do so via transendothelial pores. Finally, we found that Trojan horse crossing enables CNS entry of fungal mutants that cannot otherwise traverse the BBB, and we demonstrate additional intercellular interactions that may contribute to brain entry. Our work elucidates the mechanism of cryptococcal brain invasion and offers approaches to study other neuropathogens.",

One route that has been proposed for this brain entry is a Trojan horse mechanism, whereby the fungus crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as a passenger inside host phagocytes. Although indirect experimental evidence supports this intriguing mechanism, it has never been directly visualized. Here we directly image Trojan horse transit and show that it is regulated independently of free fungal entry, contributes to cryptococcal BBB crossing, and allows mutant fungi that cannot enter alone to invade the brain."

        "Abstract": [
            "Persisters are dormant variants that form a subpopulation of cells tolerant to antibiotics. Persisters are largely responsible for the recalcitrance of chronic infections to therapy. In Escherichia coli, one widely accepted model of persister formation holds that stochastic accumulation of ppGpp causes activation of the Lon protease that degrades antitoxins; active toxins then inhibit translation, resulting in dormant, drug-tolerant persisters. We found that various stresses induce toxin-antitoxin (TA) expression but that induction of TAs does not necessarily increase persisters. The 16S rRNA promoter rrnB P1 was proposed to be a persister reporter and an indicator of toxin activation regulated by ppGpp. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we confirmed the enrichment for persisters in the fraction of rrnB P1-gfp dim cells; however, this is independent of toxin-antitoxins. rrnB P1 is coregulated by ppGpp and ATP. We show that rrnB P1 can report persisters in a relA/spoT deletion background, suggesting that rrnB P1 is a persister marker responding to ATP. Consistent with this finding, decreasing the level of ATP by arsenate treatment causes drug tolerance. Lowering ATP slows translation and prevents the formation of DNA double-strand breaks upon ﬂuoroquinolone treatment. We conclude that variation in ATP levels leads to persister formation by decreasing the activity of antibiotic targets.",

Our current understanding of persister formation is primarily based on studies of E. coli The activation of toxin-antitoxin systems by ppGpp has become a widely accepted model for persister formation. In this study, we found that stress-induced activation of mRNA interferase-type toxins does not necessarily cause persister formation. We also found that the persister marker rrnB P1 reports persister cells because it detects a drop in cellular ATP levels. Consistent with this, lowering the ATP level decreases antibiotic target activity and, thus, leads to persister formation. We conclude that stochastic variation in ATP is the main mechanism of persister formation. A decrease in ATP provides a satisfactory explanation for the drug tolerance of persisters, since bactericidal antibiotics act by corrupting energy-dependent targets."

Here, we report the first paradigm of Ca-dependent repair following attack by a small β-pore-forming toxin, namely, plasmid-encoded phobalysin of  subsp.  In striking contrast,  cytolysin, the closest ortholog of phobalysin, subverted repair. Mutational analysis uncovered a role of channel width in toxicity and repair. Thus, the replacement of serine at phobalysin´s presumed channel narrow point with the bulkier tryptophan, the corresponding residue in  cytolysin (W318), modulated Ca influx, lysosomal exocytosis, and membrane repair. And yet, replacing tryptophan (W318) with serine in  cytolysin enhanced toxicity. The data reveal divergent strategies evolved by two related small β-pore-forming toxins to manipulate target cells: phobalysin leads to fulminant perturbation of ion concentrations, closely followed by Ca influx-dependent membrane repair. In contrast,  cytolysin causes insidious perturbations and escapes control by the cellular wounded membrane repair-like response. Previous studies demonstrated that large transmembrane pores, such as those formed by perforin or bacterial toxins of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family, trigger rapid, Ca influx-dependent repair mechanisms. In contrast, recovery from attack by the small β-pore-forming  alpha-toxin or aerolysin is slow in comparison and does not depend on extracellular Ca To further elucidate the scope of Ca influx-dependent repair and understand its limitations, we compared the cellular responses to phobalysin and  cytolysin, two related small β-pore-forming toxins which create membrane pores of slightly different sizes. The data indicate that the channel width of a small β-pore-forming toxin is a critical determinant of both primary toxicity and susceptibility to Ca-dependent repair."

            "#text": "DNA methylation is widespread among prokaryotes, and most DNA methylation reactions are catalyzed by adenine DNA methyltransferases, which are part of restriction-modification (R-M) systems. R-M systems are known for their role in the defense against foreign DNA; however, DNA methyltransferases also play functional roles in gene regulation. In this study, we used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to uncover the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in the opportunistic pathogen  PAO1. We identified a conserved sequence motif targeted by an adenine methyltransferase of a type I R-M system and quantified the presence of N-methyladenine using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Changes in the PAO1 methylation status were dependent on growth conditions and affected  pathogenicity in a  infection model. Furthermore, we found that methylated motifs in promoter regions led to shifts in sense and antisense gene expression, emphasizing the role of enzymatic DNA methylation as an epigenetic control of phenotypic traits in  Since the DNA methylation enzymes are not encoded in the core genome, our findings illustrate how the acquisition of accessory genes can shape the global  transcriptome and thus may facilitate adaptation to new and challenging habitats. With the introduction of advanced technologies, epigenetic regulation by DNA methyltransferases in bacteria has become a subject of intense studies. Here we identified an adenosine DNA methyltransferase in the opportunistic pathogen  PAO1, which is responsible for DNA methylation of a conserved sequence motif. The methylation level of all target sequences throughout the PAO1 genome was approximated to be in the range of 65 to 85% and was dependent on growth conditions. Inactivation of the methyltransferase revealed an attenuated-virulence phenotype in the  infection model. Furthermore, differential expression of more than 90 genes was detected, including the small regulatory RNA , which contributes to a global iron-sparing response via the repression of a set of gene targets. Our finding of a methylation-dependent repression of the antisense transcript of the  small regulatory RNA significantly expands our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying active DNA methylation in bacteria."

Comparative genomics showed that, in fast-growing bacteria, ribosomal protein genes (RP) locate near the replication origin (). We recently showed that  employs this positional bias as a growth optimization strategy: under fast-growth conditions, multifork replication increases RP dosage and expression. However, RP location may provide advantages in a dosage-independent manner: for example, the physical proximity of the many ribosomal components, in the context of a crowded cytoplasm, may favor ribosome biogenesis. To uncover putative dosage-independent effects, we studied isogenic  derivatives in which the major RP locus,  (S10), was relocated to alternative genomic positions. When bacteria grew fast, bacterial fitness was reduced according to the S10 relative distance to  The growth of wild-type  could not be improved by additional copies of the locus, suggesting a physiologically optimized genomic location. Slow growth is expected to uncouple RP position from dosage, since multifork replication does not occur. Under these conditions, we detected a fitness impairment when S10 was far from  Deep sequencing followed by marker frequency analysis in the absence of multifork replication revealed an up to 30% S10 dosage reduction associated with its relocation that closely correlated with fitness alterations. Hence, the impact of S10 location goes beyond a growth optimization strategy during feast periods. RP location may be important during the whole life cycle of this pathogen. The role of gene order within the bacterial chromosome is poorly understood. In fast growers, the location of genes linked with the expression of genetic information (i.e., transcription and translation) is biased toward  It was proposed that the location of these genes helps to maximize their expression by recruiting multifork replication during fast growth. Our results show that such genomic positioning impacts cell fitness beyond fast-growth conditions, probably across the whole life cycle of fast growers. Thus, the genomic position of key highly expressed genes, such as RP, was finely tuned during the evolution of fast-growing bacteria and may also be important in slow growers. In the near future, many more genes whose genomic position impacts bacterial phenotype will be described. These studies will contribute to discovery the rules of genome organization and application of them for the design of synthetic chromosomes and the creation of artificial life forms."

In the asymmetrically dividing bacterium , cell polarity stems from the cell cycle-regulated localization and turnover of signaling protein complexes in these hubs, and yet the mechanisms that establish the identity of the two cell poles have not been established. Here, we recapitulate the tripartite assembly of a cell fate signaling complex that forms during the G-S transition. Using  and  analyses of dynamic polar protein complex formation, we show that a polymeric cell polarity protein, SpmX, serves as a direct bridge between the PopZ polymeric network and the cell fate-directing DivJ histidine kinase. We demonstrate the direct binding between these three proteins and show that a polar microdomain spontaneously assembles when the three proteins are coexpressed heterologously in an  test system. The relative copy numbers of these proteins are essential for complex formation, as overexpression of SpmX in  reorganizes the polarity of the cell, generating ectopic cell poles containing PopZ and DivJ. Hierarchical formation of higher-order SpmX oligomers nucleates new PopZ microdomain assemblies at the incipient lateral cell poles, driving localized outgrowth. By comparison to self-assembling protein networks and polar cell growth mechanisms in other bacterial species, we suggest that the cooligomeric PopZ-SpmX protein complex in  illustrates a paradigm for coupling cell cycle progression to the controlled geometry of cell pole establishment. Lacking internal membrane-bound compartments, bacteria achieve subcellular organization by establishing self-assembling protein-based microdomains. The asymmetrically dividing bacterium  uses one such microdomain to link cell cycle progression to morphogenesis, but the mechanism for the generation of this microdomain has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the ordered assembly of this microdomain occurs via the polymeric network protein PopZ directly recruiting the polarity factor SpmX, which then recruits the histidine kinase DivJ to the developing cell pole. Further, we find that overexpression of the bridge protein SpmX in  disrupts this ordered assembly, generating ectopic cell poles containing both PopZ and DivJ. Together, PopZ and SpmX assemble into a cooligomeric network that forms the basis for a polar microdomain that coordinates bacterial cell polarity."

Although antifungal treatment is usually effective, many patients relapse after treatment, and in such cases, comparative analyses of the genomes of incident and relapse isolates may reveal evidence of determinative, microevolutionary changes within the host. Here, we analyzed serial isolates cultured from cerebrospinal fluid specimens of 18 South African patients with recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. The time between collection of the incident isolates and collection of the relapse isolates ranged from 124 days to 290 days, and the analyses revealed that, during this period within the patients, the isolates underwent several genetic and phenotypic changes. Considering the vast genetic diversity of cryptococcal isolates in sub-Saharan Africa, it was not surprising to find that the relapse isolates had acquired different genetic and correlative phenotypic changes. They exhibited various mechanisms for enhancing virulence, such as growth at 39°C, adaptation to stress, and capsule production; a remarkable amplification of  at the native and unlinked locus may provide stable resistance to fluconazole. Our data provide a deeper understanding of the microevolution of  species under pressure from antifungal chemotherapy and host immune responses. This investigation clearly suggests a promising strategy to identify novel targets for improved diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. Opportunistic infections caused by species of the pathogenic yeast  lead to chronic meningoencephalitis and continue to ravage thousands of patients with HIV/AIDS. Despite receiving antifungal treatment, over 10% of patients develop recurrent disease. In this study, we collected isolates of  from cerebrospinal fluid specimens of 18 patients at the time of their diagnosis and when they relapsed several months later. We then sequenced and compared the genomic DNAs of each pair of initial and relapse isolates. We also tested the isolates for several key properties related to cryptococcal virulence as well as for their susceptibility to the antifungal drug fluconazole. These analyses revealed that the relapsing isolates manifested multiple genetic and chromosomal changes that affected a variety of genes implicated in the pathogenicity of  or resistance to fluconazole. This application of comparative genomics to serial clinical isolates provides a blueprint for identifying the mechanisms whereby pathogenic microbes adapt within patients to prolong disease."

Although the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance mechanisms has been extensively studied, much less is known about how genetic variation contributes to other aspects of successful infections. Genetic changes that occur during host infection and treatment have the potential to remodel gene expression patterns related to resistance and pathogenesis. Longitudinal sets of multidrug-resistant  isolates from eight patients were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify differentially expressed genes and link them to genetic changes contributing to transcriptional variation at both within-patient and population levels. The number of differentially expressed genes among isolates from the same patient ranged from 26 (patient 588) to 145 (patient 475). Multiple patients had isolates with differential gene expression patterns related to mutations in the  and  two-component regulatory system genes, as well as significant differences in genes related to antibiotic resistance, iron acquisition, amino acid metabolism, and surface-associated proteins. Population level analysis revealed 39 genetic regions with clade-specific differentially expressed genes, for which 19, 8, and 3 of these could be explained by insertion sequence mobilization, recombination-driven sequence variation, and intergenic mutations, respectively. Multiple types of mutations that arise during infection can significantly remodel the expression of genes that are known to be important in pathogenesis. Health care-associated multidrug-resistant  can cause persistent infections in patients, but bacterial cells must overcome host defenses and antibiotic therapies to do so. Genetic variation arises during host infection, and new mutations are often enriched in genes encoding transcriptional regulators, iron acquisition systems, and surface-associated structures. In this study, genetic variation was shown to result in transcriptome remodeling at the level of individual patients and across phylogenetic groups. Differentially expressed genes include those related to capsule modification, iron acquisition, type I pili, and antibiotic resistance. Population level transcriptional variation reflects genome dynamics over longer evolutionary time periods, and convergent transcriptional changes support the adaptive significance of these regions. Transcriptional changes can be attributed to multiple types of genomic change, but insertion sequence mobilization had a predominant effect. The transcriptional effects of mutations that arise during infection highlight the rapid adaptation of  during host exposure."

Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the reduced levels of  transmission between hosts immune from prior exposure and among vaccinated children. Rates of carriage of the bacterial pathogen  are highest among young children, and this is the target group for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).

In this study, we examined the role of anti-pneumococcal immunity on nasal shedding and transmission of the pathogen using an infant mouse model. We found that shedding is decreased and transmission is blocked by anti-pneumococcal immunity and PCV vaccination. Additionally, transmission rates decreased if either the infected or contact pups were immune, indicating that reduced shedding and protection from the establishment of colonization are both contributing factors. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the herd immunity effect seen after the introduction of PCV and identifies potential points of intervention, which may have implications for future vaccine development."

Therefore, bacterial lipocalins contribute to antimicrobial resistance by capturing diverse antibiotics in the extracellular space at the site of infection, which can be counteracted by known vitamins. Current research on antibiotic action and resistance focuses on targeting essential functions within bacterial cells. We discovered a previously unrecognized mode of general bacterial antibiotic resistance operating in the extracellular space, which depends on bacterial protein molecules called lipocalins. These molecules are highly conserved in most bacteria and have the ability to capture different classes of antibiotics outside bacterial cells. We also discovered that liposoluble vitamins, such as vitamin E, overcome  and  antibiotic resistance mediated by bacterial lipocalins, providing an unexpected new alternative to combat resistance by using this vitamin or its derivatives as antibiotic adjuvants."

Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1; CD66a), CEACAM5 (CEA), and CEACAM6 (CD66c) are immunomodulatory receptors expressed on human mucosa and are recruited by bacterial and viral pathogens. Here we show for the first time that a fungal pathogen (i.e., ) also binds directly to the extracellular domain of human CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6.

Lack of the CEACAM1 receptor after short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown abolished CXCL8 (interleukin-8) secretion by C2BBe1 cells in response to  In CEACAM1-competent cells, the addition of recombinant soluble CEACAM6 reduced the -induced CXCL8 secretion. The present study demonstrates for the first time that fungal pathogens can be recognized by at least four members of the immunomodulatory CEACAM receptor family: CEACAM1, -3, -5, and -6. Three of the four receptors (i.e., CEACAM1, -5, and -6) are expressed in mucosal cells of the intestinal tract, where they are implicated in immunomodulation and control of tissue homeostasis. Importantly, the interaction of the major fungal pathogen in humans  with CEACAM1 and CEACAM6 resulted in an altered epithelial immune response. With respect to the broad impact of CEACAM receptors on various aspects of the innate and the adaptive immune responses, in particular epithelial, neutrophil, and T cell behavior, understanding the role of CEACAMs in the host response to fungal pathogens might help to improve management of superficial and systemic fungal infections."

Meningococci adapt to diverse local host conditions differing in nutrient supply, like the nasopharynx, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid, by changing metabolism and protein repertoire. However, regulatory transcription factors and two-component systems in meningococci involved in adaptation to local nutrient variations are limited. We identified novel sibling small regulatory RNAs ( etabolic witch egulators [NmsRs]) regulating switches between cataplerotic and anaplerotic metabolism in this pathogen. Overexpression of NmsRs was tolerated in blood but not in cerebrospinal fluid. Expression of six tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes was downregulated by direct action of NmsRs. Expression of the NmsRs themselves was under the control of the stringent response through the action of RelA. Small sibling regulatory RNAs of meningococci, controlling general metabolic switches, add an exciting twist to their versatile repertoire in bacterial pathogens. Regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) of pathogens are coming to be recognized as highly important components of riboregulatory networks, involved in the control of essential cellular processes. They play a prominent role in adaptation to physiological changes as represented by different host environments. They can function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression to orchestrate metabolic adaptation to nutrient stresses. Here, we identified highly conserved sibling sRNAs in  which are functionally involved in the regulation of gene expression of components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These novel sibling sRNAs that function by antisense mechanisms extend the so-called stringent response which connects metabolic status to colonization and possibly virulence as well as pathogenesis in meningococci."

            "#text": "Purple nonsulfur bacteria adapt their physiology to a wide variety of environmental conditions often through the control of transcription. One of the main transcription factors involved in controlling expression of the  photosystem is CrtJ, which functions as an aerobic repressor of photosystem genes. Recently, we reported that a vitamin B binding antirepressor of CrtJ called AerR is required for anaerobic expression of the photosystem. However, the mechanism whereby AerR regulates CrtJ activity is unclear. In this study, we used a combination of next-generation sequencing and biochemical methods to globally identify genes under control of CrtJ and the role of AerR in controlling this regulation. Our results indicate that CrtJ has a much larger regulon than previously known, with a surprising regulatory function under both aerobic and anaerobic photosynthetic growth conditions. A combination of  chromatin immunoprecipitation-DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) and ChIP-seq and exonuclease digestion (ChIP-exo) studies and  biochemical studies demonstrate that AerR forms a 1:2 complex with CrtJ (AerR-CrtJ) and that this complex binds to many promoters under photosynthetic conditions. The results of  and  DNA binding studies indicate that AerR-CrtJ anaerobically forms an extended interaction with the bacteriochlorophyll  promoter to relieve repression by CrtJ. This is contrasted by aerobic growth conditions where CrtJ alone functions as an aerobic repressor of  expression. These results indicate that the DNA binding activity of CrtJ is modified by interacting with AerR in a redox-regulated manner and that this interaction alters CrtJ's function. Photoreceptors control a wide range of physiology often by regulating downstream gene expression in response to light absorption via a bound chromophore. Different photoreceptors are known to utilize a number of different compounds for light absorption, including the use of such compounds as flavins, linearized tetrapyrroles (bilins), and carotenoids. Recently, a novel class of photoreceptors that use vitamin B (cobalamin) as a blue-light-absorbing chromophore have been described. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism by which the vitamin B binding photoreceptor AerR controls the DNA binding activity of the photosystem regulator CrtJ. This study shows that a direct interaction between the vitamin B binding photoreceptor AerR with CrtJ modulates CrtJ binding to DNA and importantly, the regulatory outcome of gene expression, as shown here with photosystem promoters."

While many examples have been documented, a comprehensive list of RNase targets is not available. To address this knowledge gap, we compared levels of RNA sequencing coverage of  and a corresponding RNase III mutant to expand the list of known RNase III targets. RNase III is a widespread endoribonuclease that binds and cleaves double-stranded RNA in many critical transcripts. RNase III cleavage at novel sites found in , , , , , , , , , and  accelerated RNA decay, consistent with previously described targets wherein RNase III cleavage initiates rapid degradation of secondary messages by other RNases. In contrast, cleavage at three novel sites in the , , and  transcripts led to stabilized secondary transcripts. Two other novel sites in  and  overlapped with transcriptional attenuators that likely serve to ensure turnover of these highly structured RNAs. Many of the new RNase III target sites are located on transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes. For instance, two novel RNase III sites are located within transcripts encoding enzymes near a key metabolic node connecting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was increased in an  deletion mutant compared to the wild-type (WT) strain in early stationary phase, confirming the novel link between RNA turnover and regulation of pathway activity. Identification of these novel sites suggests that mRNA turnover may be an underappreciated mode of regulating metabolism. The concerted action and overlapping functions of endoribonucleases, exoribonucleases, and RNA processing enzymes complicate the study of global RNA turnover and recycling of specific transcripts. More information about RNase specificity and activity is needed to make predictions of transcript half-life and to design synthetic transcripts with optimal stability. RNase III does not have a conserved target sequence but instead recognizes RNA secondary structure. Prior to this study, only a few RNase III target sites in  were known, so we used RNA sequencing to provide a more comprehensive list of cleavage sites and to examine the impact of RNase III on transcript degradation. With this added information on how RNase III participates in transcript regulation and recycling, a more complete picture of RNA turnover can be developed for  Similar approaches could be used to augment our understanding of RNA turnover in other bacteria."

Two classes of CdiA effectors that bind distinct cell surface receptors have been identified, but the molecular basis of receptor specificity is not understood. Alignment of BamA-specific CdiA from  EC93 and OmpC-specific CdiA from  536 suggests that the receptor-binding domain resides within a central region that varies between the two effectors. In support of this hypothesis, we find that CdiA fragments containing residues Arg1358 to Phe1646 bind specifically to purified BamA. Moreover, chimeric CdiA that carries the corresponding sequence from CdiA is endowed with OmpC-binding activity, demonstrating that this region dictates receptor specificity. A survey of  CdiA proteins reveals two additional effector classes, which presumably recognize distinct receptors. Using a genetic approach, we identify the outer membrane nucleoside transporter Tsx as the receptor for a third class of CdiA effectors. Thus, CDI systems exploit multiple outer membrane proteins to identify and engage target cells. These results underscore the modularity of CdiA proteins and suggest that novel effectors can be constructed through genetic recombination to interchange different receptor-binding domains and toxic payloads. CdiB/CdiA two-partner secretion proteins mediate interbacterial competition through the delivery of polymorphic toxin domains. This process, known as contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI), requires stable interactions between the CdiA effector protein and specific receptors on the surface of target bacteria. Here, we localize the receptor-binding domain to the central region of  CdiA. Receptor-binding domains vary between CdiA proteins, and  strains collectively encode at least four distinct effector classes. Further, we show that receptor specificity can be altered by exchanging receptor-binding regions, demonstrating the modularity of this domain. We propose that novel CdiA effectors are naturally generated through genetic recombination to interchange different receptor-binding domains and toxin payloads."

They have molecular characteristics typical of other animal BPIs, are closely related to one another, and nest phylogenetically among invertebrate BPIs. Purified EsBPIs had antimicrobial activity against the squid's symbiont, , which colonizes light organ crypt epithelia. Activity of both proteins was abrogated by heat treatment and coincubation with specific antibodies. Pretreatment under acidic conditions similar to those during symbiosis initiation rendered  more resistant to the antimicrobial activity of the proteins. Immunocytochemistry localized EsBPIs to the symbiotic organ and other epithelial surfaces interacting with ambient seawater. The proteins differed in intracellular distribution. Further, whereas EsBPI4 was restricted to epithelia, EsBPI2 also occurred in blood and in a transient juvenile organ that mediates hatching. The data provide evidence that these BPIs play different defensive roles early in the life of , modulating interactions with the symbiont. This study describes new functions for bactericidal permeability-increasing proteins (BPIs), members of the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP)/BPI protein family. The data provide evidence that these proteins play a dual role in the modulation of symbiotic bacteria. In the squid-vibrio model, these proteins both control the symbiont populations in the light organ tissues where symbiont cells occur in dense monoculture and, concomitantly, inhibit the symbiont from colonizing other epithelial surfaces of the animal."

            "#text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection persists despite decades of active antiretroviral therapy (ART), effectively preventing viral eradication. Treatment decreases plasma viral RNA, but viral DNA persists, mostly integrated within the genome of nucleated blood cells. Viral DNA blood levels correlate with comorbidities and the rapidity of viral rebound following treatment interruption. To date, no intervention aiming at decreasing HIV DNA levels below those attained through ART has been successful. This includes use of some integrase inhibitors either as part of ART or in treatment intensification studies. We have argued that using the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir (DTG) in similar studies may yield better results, but this remains to be studied. In treatment-experienced individuals, the most frequent substitution associated with failure with dolutegravir is R263K in integrase. R263K decreases integration both in cell-free and tissue culture assays. We investigated here how integrated DNA levels evolve over time during prolonged infections with R263K viruses. To investigate a potential defect in reverse transcription with R263K, the levels of reverse transcripts were measured by quantitative PCR. We measured HIV type 1 (HIV-1) integration in Jurkat cells over the course of 4-week infections using Alu-mediated quantitative PCR. The results show that R263K did not decrease reverse transcription. Prolonged infections with R263K mutant viruses led to less HIV-1 integrated DNA over time compared to wild-type viruses. These tissue culture results help to explain the absence of the R263K substitution in most individuals experiencing failure with DTG and support studies aiming at longitudinally measuring the levels of integrated DNA in individuals treated with this drug. Antiretroviral treatment decreases plasma viral RNA, but HIV DNA persists for decades within infected cells. Studies of nonhuman primates have suggested that reducing retroviral DNA levels might represent a path to eradication. The integrase inhibitor dolutegravir is less susceptible than any other anti-HIV drug to the emergence of resistance in treatment-naive individuals. In treatment-experienced individuals, in contrast, rare cases of treatment failure were commonly associated with emergence of an R263K integrase substitution that confers low-level resistance to dolutegravir. It is unclear why this substitution is not more common in individuals experiencing failure with dolutegravir. We report here that R263K progressively diminishes the levels of integrated HIV-1 DNA in tissue culture over multiple cycles of infection. Our results help to explain aspects of the clinical efficacy of dolutegravir and suggest that this drug may be able to reduce HIV DNA levels within infected individuals compared to other drugs."

            "#text": "Phase variation occurs in many pathogenic and commensal bacteria and is a major generator of genetic variability. A putative advantage of phase variation is to counter reductions in variability imposed by nonselective bottlenecks during transmission. Genomes of , a widespread food-borne pathogen, contain multiple phase-variable loci whose rapid, stochastic variation is generated by hypermutable simple sequence repeat tracts. These loci can occupy a vast number of combinatorial expression states (phasotypes) enabling populations to rapidly access phenotypic diversity. The imposition of nonselective bottlenecks can perturb the relative frequencies of phasotypes, changing both within-population diversity and divergence from the initial population. Using both  testing of  populations and a simple stochastic simulation of phasotype change, we observed that single-cell bottlenecks produce output populations of low diversity but with bimodal patterns of either high or low divergence. Conversely, large bottlenecks allow divergence only by accumulation of diversity, while interpolation between these extremes is observed in intermediary bottlenecks. These patterns are sensitive to the genetic diversity of initial populations but stable over a range of mutation rates and number of loci. The qualitative similarities of experimental and  modeling indicate that the observed patterns are robust and applicable to other systems where localized hypermutation is a defining feature. We conclude that while phase variation will maintain bacterial population diversity in the face of intermediate bottlenecks, narrow transmission-associated bottlenecks could produce host-to-host variation in bacterial phenotypes and hence stochastic variation in colonization and disease outcomes. Transmission and within-host spread of pathogenic organisms are associated with selective and nonselective bottlenecks that significantly reduced population diversity. In several bacterial pathogens, hypermutable mechanisms have evolved that mediate high-frequency reversible switching of specific phenotypes, such as surface structures, and hence counteract bottleneck-associated reductions in population diversity. Here, we investigated how combinations of hypermutable simple sequence repeats interact with nonselective bottlenecks by using a stochastic computer model and experimental data for , a food-borne pathogen. We find that bottleneck size qualitatively alters the output populations, with large bottlenecks maintaining population diversity while small bottlenecks produce dramatic shifts in the prevalence of particular variants. We conclude that narrow bottlenecks are capable of producing host-to-host variation in repeat-controlled bacterial phenotypes, leading to a potential for stochastic person-to-person variations in disease outcome for  and other organisms with similar hypermutable mechanisms."

Overexpression of the MtrCDE efflux pump increases gonococcal survival and fitness during experimental lower genital tract infection of female mice. Transcription of  can be repressed by the DNA-binding protein MtrR, which also acts as a global regulator of genes involved in important metabolic, physiologic, or regulatory processes. Here, we investigated whether a gene downstream of , previously annotated  in , is a target for regulation by MtrR. In meningococci, GdhR serves as a regulator of genes involved in glucose catabolism, amino acid transport, and biosynthesis, including , which encodes an l-glutamate dehydrogenase and is located next to  but is transcriptionally divergent. We report here that in , expression of  is subject to autoregulation by GdhR and direct repression by MtrR. Importantly, loss of GdhR significantly increased gonococcal fitness compared to a complemented mutant strain during experimental murine infection. Interestingly, loss of GdhR did not influence expression of , as reported for meningococci. This variance is most likely due to differences in promoter localization and utilization between gonococci and meningococci. We propose that transcriptional control of gonococcal genes through the action of MtrR and GdhR contributes to fitness of  during infection. The pathogenic  species are strict human pathogens that can cause a sexually transmitted infection () or meningitis or fulminant septicemia (). Although they share considerable genetic information, little attention has been directed to comparing transcriptional regulatory systems that modulate expression of their conserved genes. We hypothesized that transcriptional regulatory differences exist between these two pathogens, and we used the  locus as a model to test this idea. For this purpose, we studied two conserved genes ( and ) within the locus. Despite general conservation of the  locus in gonococci and meningococci, differences exist in noncoding sequences that correspond to promoter elements or potential sites for interacting with DNA-binding proteins, such as GdhR and MtrR. Our results indicate that implications drawn from studying regulation of conserved genes in one pathogen are not necessarily translatable to a genetically related pathogen."

            "#text": "Replication of  chromosome 2 (Chr2) depends on molecular chaperone DnaK to facilitate binding of the initiator (RctB) to the replication origin. The binding occurs at two kinds of site, 12-mers and 39-mers, which promote and inhibit replication, respectively. Here we show that DnaK employs different mechanisms to enhance the two kinds of binding. We found that mutations in  that reduce DnaK binding also reduce 12-mer binding and initiation. The initiation defect is suppressed by second-site mutations that increase 12-mer binding only marginally. Instead, they reduce replication inhibitory mechanisms: RctB dimerization and 39-mer binding. One suppressing change was in a dimerization domain which is folded similarly to the initiator of an iteron plasmid-the presumed progenitor of Chr2. In plasmids, DnaK promotes initiation by reducing dimerization. A different mutation was in the 39-mer binding domain of RctB and inactivated it, indicating an alternative suppression mechanism. Paradoxically, although DnaK increases 39-mer binding, the increase was also achieved by inactivating the DnaK binding site of RctB. This result suggests that the site inhibits the 39-mer binding domain (via autoinhibition) when prevented from binding DnaK. Taken together, our results reveal an important feature of the transition from plasmid to chromosome: the Chr2 initiator retains the plasmid-like dimerization domain and its control by chaperones but uses the chaperones in an unprecedented way to control the inhibitory 39-mer binding. The capacity of proteins to undergo remodeling provides opportunities to control their function. However, remodeling remains a poorly understood aspect of the structure-function paradigm due to its dynamic nature. Here we have studied remodeling of the initiator of replication of  Chr2 by the molecular chaperone, DnaK. We show that DnaK binds to a site on the Chr2 initiator (RctB) that promotes initiation by reducing the initiator's propensity to dimerize. Dimerization of the initiator of the putative plasmid progenitor of Chr2 is also reduced by DnaK, which promotes initiation. Paradoxically, the DnaK binding also promotes replication inhibition by reducing an autoinhibitory activity of RctB. In the plasmid-to-chromosome transition, it appears that the initiator has acquired an autoinhibitory activity and along with it a new chaperone activity that apparently helps to control replication inhibition independently of replication promotion."

Here we characterize genes, called  and , which encode proteins that contain domains similar to those corresponding to trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase but lack critical catalytic residues for phosphatase activity. Loss of  reduces trehalose content in both conidia and mycelia, impairs cell wall integrity, and significantly alters cell wall structure. To gain mechanistic insights into the role that TslA plays in cell wall homeostasis, immunoprecipitation assays coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used to reveal a direct interaction between TslA and CsmA, a type V chitin synthase enzyme. TslA regulates not only chitin synthase activity but also CsmA sub-cellular localization. Loss of TslA impacts the immunopathogenesis of murine invasive pulmonary aspergillosis through altering cytokine production and immune cell recruitment. In conclusion, our data provide a novel model whereby proteins in the trehalose pathway play a direct role in fungal cell wall homeostasis and consequently impact fungus-host interactions. Human fungal infections are increasing globally due to HIV infections and increased use of immunosuppressive therapies for many diseases. Therefore, new antifungal drugs with reduced side effects and increased efficacy are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Trehalose biosynthesis exists in pathogenic fungi and is absent in humans. Components of the trehalose biosynthesis pathway are important for the virulence of human-pathogenic fungi, including  Consequently, it has been proposed that components of this pathway are potential targets for antifungal drug development. However, how trehalose biosynthesis influences the fungus-host interaction remains enigmatic. One phenotype associated with fungal trehalose biosynthesis mutants that remains enigmatic is cell wall perturbation. Here we discovered a novel moonlighting role for a regulatory-like subunit of the trehalose biosynthesis pathway in  that regulates cell wall homeostasis through modulation of chitin synthase localization and activity. As the cell wall is a current and promising therapeutic target for fungal infections, understanding the role of trehalose biosynthesis in cell wall homeostasis and virulence is expected to help define new therapeutic opportunities."

            "#text": "Experiments examining the social dynamics of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) have focused on mutants which do not respond to signals and the role of QS-regulated exoproducts as public goods. The potential for QS signal molecules to themselves be social public goods has received much less attention. Here, we analyze how signal-deficient () mutants of the opportunistic pathogen  interact with wild-type cells in an environment where QS is required for growth. We show that when growth requires a \"private\" intracellular metabolic mechanism activated by the presence of QS signal,  mutants act as social cheats and outcompete signal-producing wild-type bacteria in mixed cultures, because they can exploit the signals produced by wild-type cells. However, reducing the ability of signal molecules to diffuse through the growth medium results in signal molecules becoming less accessible to mutants, leading to reduced cheating. Our results indicate that QS signal molecules can be considered social public goods in a way that has been previously described for other exoproducts but that spatial structuring of populations reduces exploitation by noncooperative signal cheats. Bacteria communicate via signaling molecules to regulate the expression of a whole range of genes. This process, termed quorum sensing (QS), moderates bacterial metabolism under many environmental conditions, from soil and water (where QS-regulated genes influence nutrient cycling) to animal hosts (where QS-regulated genes determine pathogen virulence). Understanding the ecology of QS could therefore yield vital clues to how we might modify bacterial behavior for environmental or clinical gains. Here, we demonstrate that QS signals act as shareable public goods. This means that their evolution, and therefore population-level responses to interference with QS, will be constrained by population structure. Further, we show that environmental structure (constraints on signal diffusion) alters the accessibility of QS signals and demonstrates that we need to consider population and environmental structure to help us further our understanding of QS signaling systems."

We identified a set of  genes encoding catabolic enzymes and transport systems for amino acids required for  growth whose expression was modulated by SCFAs.

Conversely, the organic acid lactate, which is abundant in the upper intestinal tract where  colonizes less efficiently, reduced expression of these genes. We propose that microbiota-generated SCFAs and lactate are cues for  to discriminate between different intestinal regions. Spatial gradients of these metabolites likely allow  to locate preferred niches in the lower intestinal tract and induce expression of factors required for intestinal growth and commensal colonization. Our findings provide insights into the types of cues  monitors in the avian host for commensalism and likely in humans to promote diarrheal disease. is a commensal of the intestinal tracts of avian species and other animals and a leading cause of diarrheal disease in humans.

These genes include those encoding catabolic enzymes and transport systems for amino acids that are required by  for  growth and intestinal colonization. We propose that gradients of these microbiota-generated metabolites are cues for spatial discrimination between areas of the intestines so that the bacterium can locate niches in the lower intestinal tract for optimal growth for commensalism in avian species and possibly infection of human hosts leading to diarrheal disease."

We previously showed that loss of RND-mediated efflux in  resulted in activation of the Cpx two-component regulatory system, which mediates adaptation to stress resulting from misfolded membrane proteins. Here, we investigated the mechanism linking RND-mediated efflux to the Cpx response. We performed transposon mutagenesis screening of RND-deficient  to identify Cpx suppressors. Suppressor mutations mapped to genes involved in the biosynthesis of the catechol siderophore vibriobactin. We subsequently demonstrated that vibriobactin secretion is impaired in mutants lacking the VexGH RND efflux system and that impaired vibriobactin secretion is responsible for Cpx system activation, suggesting that VexGH secretes vibriobactin. This conclusion was bolstered by results showing that  expression is induced by iron limitation and that -deficient cells exhibit reduced fitness during growth under iron-limiting conditions. Our results support a model where VexGH contributes to cellular homeostasis by effluxing vibriobactin. In the absence of , retained vibriobactin appears to chelate iron from iron-rich components of the respiratory chain, with the deferrated proteins functioning to activate the Cpx response. Our collective results demonstrate that a native function of the  VexGH RND efflux system is in vibriobactin secretion and that vibriobactin efflux is critical for maintenance of cellular homeostasis. RND efflux systems are ubiquitous Gram-negative transporters that play critical roles in antimicrobial resistance. In addition to antimicrobial resistance, RND transporters also affect the expression of diverse phenotypes, including virulence, cell metabolism, and stress responses. The latter observations suggest that RND transporters fulfill unknown physiological functions in the cell independently of their role in antimicrobial resistance.  is representative of many Gram-negative bacteria in encoding multiple RND transporters that are redundant in antimicrobial resistance and affect multiple phenotypes. Here we describe a novel function of the  VexGH RND transporter in vibriobactin secretion. We show that vibriobactin production in VexGH-deficient cells impacts cell homeostasis, leading to activation of the Cpx stress response and reduced fitness under iron-limiting conditions. Our results highlight a native physiological function of an RND transporter and provide insight into the selective forces that maintain what was thought to be a redundant multidrug transporter."

            "#text": "Cells rely on accurate control of signaling systems to adapt to environmental perturbations. System deactivation upon stimulus removal is as important as activation of signaling pathways. The two-component system (TCS) is one of the major bacterial signaling schemes. In many TCSs, phosphatase activity of the histidine kinase (HK) is believed to play an essential role in shutting off the pathway and resetting the system to the prestimulus state. Two basic challenges are to understand the dynamic behavior of system deactivation and to quantitatively evaluate the role of phosphatase activity under natural cellular conditions. Here we report a kinetic analysis of the response to shutting off the archetype  PhoR-PhoB TCS pathway using both transcription reporter assays and  phosphorylation analyses. Upon removal of the stimulus, the pathway is shut off by rapid dephosphorylation of the PhoB response regulator (RR) while PhoB-regulated gene products gradually reset to prestimulus levels through growth dilution. We developed an approach combining experimentation and modeling to assess  kinetic parameters of the phosphatase activity with kinetic data from multiple phosphatase-diminished mutants. This enabled an estimation of the PhoR phosphatase activity , which is much stronger than the phosphatase activity of PhoR cytoplasmic domains analyzed  We quantitatively modeled how strong the phosphatase activity needs to be to suppress nonspecific phosphorylation in TCSs and discovered that strong phosphatase activity of PhoR is required for cross-phosphorylation suppression. Activation of TCSs has been extensively studied; however, the kinetics of shutting off TCS pathways is not well characterized. We present comprehensive analyses of the shutoff response for the PhoR-PhoB system that reveal the impact of phosphatase activity on shutoff kinetics. This allows development of a quantitative framework not only to characterize the phosphatase activity in the natural cellular environment but also to understand the requirement for specific strengths of phosphatase activity to suppress nonspecific phosphorylation. Our model suggests that the ratio of the phosphatase rate to the nonspecific phosphorylation rate correlates with TCS expression levels and the ratio of the RR to HK, which may contribute to the great diversity of enzyme levels and activities observed in different TCSs."

The diversity of signaling networks in a single species has been postulated to allow custom responses to different stimuli; however, little is known about how multiple signals are integrated and the implications of this integration in different ecological contexts. In the plant pathogen  (formerly ), two signaling networks-the N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing system and the Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway-control the expression of secreted plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, its major virulence determinants. We show that the AHL system controls the Gac/Rsm system by affecting the expression of the regulatory RNA RsmB. This regulation is mediated by ExpR2, the quorum-sensing receptor that responds to the  cognate AHL but also to AHLs produced by other bacterial species. As a consequence, this level of regulation allows  to bypass the Gac-dependent regulation of RsmB in the presence of exogenous AHLs or AHL-producing bacteria. We provide  evidence that this pivotal role of RsmB in signal transduction is important for the ability of  to induce virulence in response to other AHL-producing bacteria in multispecies plant lesions. Our results suggest that the signaling architecture in  was coopted to prime the bacteria to eavesdrop on other bacteria and quickly join the efforts of other species, which are already exploiting host resources. Quorum-sensing mechanisms enable bacteria to communicate through small signal molecules and coordinate group behaviors. Often, bacteria have various quorum-sensing receptors and integrate information with other signal transduction pathways, presumably allowing them to respond to different ecological contexts. The plant pathogen  has two N-acyl homoserine lactone receptors with apparently the same regulatory functions. Our work revealed that the receptor with the broadest signal specificity is also responsible for establishing the link between the main signaling pathways regulating virulence in  This link is essential to provide  with the ability to induce virulence earlier in response to higher densities of other bacterial species. We further present  evidence that this novel regulatory link enables  to join related bacteria in the effort to degrade host tissue in multispecies plant lesions. Our work provides support for the hypothesis that interspecies interactions are among the major factors influencing the network architectures observed in bacterial quorum-sensing pathways."

            "#text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) RNA segments are individually packaged with viral nucleoprotein (NP) and RNA polymerases to form a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. We previously reported that NP is a monoubiquitinated protein which can be deubiquitinated by a cellular ubiquitin protease, USP11. In this study, we identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase, CNOT4 (Ccr4-Not transcription complex subunit 4), which can ubiquitinate NP. We found that the levels of viral RNA, protein, viral particles, and RNA polymerase activity in CNOT4 knockdown cells were lower than those in the control cells upon IAV infection. Conversely, overexpression of CNOT4 rescued viral RNP activity. In addition, CNOT4 interacted with the NP in the cell. An  ubiquitination assay also showed that NP could be ubiquitinated by -translated CNOT4, but ubiquitination did not affect the protein stability of NP. Significantly, CNOT4 increased NP ubiquitination, whereas USP11 decreased it. Mass spectrometry analysis of ubiquitinated NP revealed multiple ubiquitination sites on the various lysine residues of NP. Three of these, K184, K227, and K273, are located on the RNA-binding groove of NP. Mutations of these sites to arginine reduced viral RNA replication. These results indicate that CNOT4 is a ubiquitin ligase of NP, and ubiquitination of NP plays a positive role in viral RNA replication. Influenza virus, particularly influenza A virus, causes severe and frequent outbreaks among human and avian species. Finding potential target sites for antiviral agents is of utmost importance from the public health point of view. We previously found that viral nucleoprotein (NP) is ubiquitinated, and ubiquitination enhances viral RNA replication. In this study, we found a cellular ubiquitin ligase, CNOT4, capable of ubiquitinating NP. The ubiquitination sites are scattered on the surface of the NP molecule, which is critical for RNA replication. CNOT4 and a ubiquitin protease, USP11, together regulate the extent of NP ubiquitination and thereby the efficiency of RNA replication. This study thus identifies a potential antiviral target site and reveals a novel posttranslational mechanism for regulating viral replication. This represents a novel finding in the literature of influenza virus research."

In the case of many pathogens, a large change in their environment occurs when they move from a natural setting to a setting within a human host and then during the course of disease development to various locations within that host. Two clinical isolates of the human fungal pathogen  were identified from a collection of environmental and clinical strains that exhibited a mutator phenotype, which is a phenotype which provides the ability to change rapidly due to the accumulation of DNA mutations at high frequency. Whole-genome analysis of these strains revealed mutations in  of the mismatch repair pathway, and complementation confirmed that these mutations are responsible for the mutator phenotype. Comparison of mutation frequencies in deletion strains of eight mismatch repair pathway genes in  showed that the loss of three of them, , , and , results in an increase in mutation rates. Increased mutation rates enable rapid microevolution to occur in these strains, generating phenotypic variations in traits associated with the ability to grow , in addition to allowing rapid generation of resistance to antifungal agents. Mutation of  reduced virulence, whereas mutation of  or  had no effect on the level of virulence. These findings thus support the hypothesis that this pathogenic fungus can take advantage of a mutator phenotype in order to cause disease but that it can do so only in specific pathways that lead to a mutator trait without a significant tradeoff in fitness. Fungi account for a large number of infections that are extremely difficult to treat; superficial fungal infections affect approximately 1.7 billion (25%) of the general population worldwide, and systemic fungal diseases result in an unacceptably high mortality rate. How fungi adapt to their hosts is not fully understood. This research investigated the role of changes to DNA sequences in adaption to the host environment and the ability to cause disease in , one of the world's most common and most deadly fungal pathogens. The study results showed that microevolutionary rates are enhanced in either clinical isolates or in gene deletion strains with  mutations. This gene has similar functions in regulating the rapid emergence of antifungal drug resistance in a distant fungal relative of , the pathogen  Thus, microevolution resulting from enhanced mutation rates may be a common contributor to fungal pathogenesis."

Here, two motifs (M1 and M2) were identified in AbcR1 and AbcR2, and complementary motif sequences were defined in AbcR-regulated transcripts. Site-directed mutagenesis of M1 or M2 or of both M1 and M2 in the sRNAs revealed transcripts to be targeted by one or both motifs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed direct, concentration-dependent binding of both AbcR sRNAs to a target mRNA sequence. These experiments genetically and biochemically characterized two indispensable motifs within the AbcR sRNAs that bind to and regulate transcripts. Additionally, cellular and animal models of infection demonstrated that only M2 in the AbcR sRNAs is required for  virulence. Furthermore, one of the M2-regulated targets, BAB2_0612, was found to be critical for the virulence of  in a mouse model of infection. Although these sRNAs are highly conserved among , the present report displays how gene regulation mediated by the AbcR sRNAs has diverged to meet the intricate regulatory requirements of each particular organism and its unique biological niche.

These strategies have yet to find wide industrial utilization due to their inability to economically compete with traditional extraction and chemical production methods. Here, we engineer for the first time the complex microbial biosynthesis of an anthocyanin plant natural product, starting from sugar. This was accomplished through the development of a synthetic, 4-strain  polyculture collectively expressing 15 exogenous or modified pathway enzymes from diverse plants and other microbes. This synthetic consortium-based approach enables the functional expression and connection of lengthy pathways while effectively managing the accompanying metabolic burden. The  production of specific anthocyanin molecules, such as calistephin, has been an elusive metabolic engineering target for over a decade. The utilization of our polyculture strategy affords milligram-per-liter production titers. This study also lays the groundwork for significant advances in strain and process design toward the development of cost-competitive biochemical production hosts through nontraditional methodologies. To efficiently express active extensive recombinant pathways with high flux in microbial hosts requires careful balance and allocation of metabolic resources such as ATP, reducing equivalents, and malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA), as well as various other pathway-dependent cofactors and precursors. To address this issue, we report the design, characterization, and implementation of the first synthetic 4-strain polyculture. Division of the overexpression of 15 enzymes and transcription factors over 4 independent strain modules allowed for the division of metabolic burden and for independent strain optimization for module-specific metabolite needs. This study represents the most complex synthetic consortia constructed to date for metabolic engineering applications and provides a new paradigm in metabolic engineering for the reconstitution of extensive metabolic pathways in nonnative hosts."

            "#text": "Despite years of research and clinical advances, chronic pulmonary infections with mucoid  remain the primary concern for cystic fibrosis patients. Much of the research on these strains has focused on the contributions of the polysaccharide alginate; however, it is becoming evident that the neutral polysaccharide Psl also contributes to biofilm formation and the maintenance of chronic infections. Here, we demonstrate that Psl produced by mucoid strains has significant roles in biofilm structure and evasion of immune effectors. Though mucoid strains produce less Psl than nonmucoid strains, the Psl that is produced is functional, since it mediates adhesion to human airway cells and epithelial cell death. Additionally, Psl protects mucoid bacteria from opsonization and killing by complement components in human serum. Psl production by mucoid strains stimulates a proinflammatory response in the murine lung, leading to reduced colonization. To determine the relevance of these data to clinical infections, we tested Psl production and biofilm formation of a panel of mucoid clinical isolates. We demonstrated three classes of mucoid isolates, those that produce Psl and form robust biofilms, those that did not produce Psl and have a poor biofilm phenotype, and exopolysaccharide (EPS) redundant strains. Collectively, these experimental results demonstrate that Psl contributes to the biofilm formation and immune evasion of many mucoid strains. This is a novel role for Psl in the establishment and maintenance of chronic pulmonary infections by mucoid strains. Cystic fibrosis patients are engaged in an ongoing battle against chronic lung infections by the bacterium  One key factor contributing to the maintenance of chronic infections is the conversion to a mucoid phenotype, where the bacteria produce copious amounts of the polysaccharide alginate. Once the bacteria become mucoid, existing treatments are poorly effective. We proposed that mucoid bacteria produce an additional polysaccharide, Psl, which is important for their establishment and maintenance of chronic infections. This work demonstrates that Psl enhances attachment of mucoid bacteria to lung surfaces and leads to inflammation and damage in the lung. Additionally, we find that 50% of mucoid bacteria isolated from patients with chronic infections rely on Psl for the structure of their biofilm communities, suggesting that treatments against Psl should be investigated to enhance the success of current therapies."

After heat shock, to which sexual but not asexual spores are highly resistant, the azole-free compost yielded 98% (49/50) wild-type and 2% (1/50) azole-resistant isolates, whereas the azole-containing compost yielded 9% (4/45) wild-type and 91% (41/45) resistant isolates. From the latter compost, 80% (36/45) of the isolates contained the TR/Y121F/T289A genotype, 2% (1/45) harbored the TR/Y121F/M172I/T289A/G448S genotype, and 9% (4/45) had a novel pan-triazole-resistant mutation (TR/Y121F/M172I/T289A/G448S) with a triple 46-bp promoter repeat. Subsequent screening of a representative set of clinical  isolates showed that the novel TR mutant was already present in samples from three Dutch medical centers collected since 2012. Furthermore, a second new resistance mutation was found in this set that harbored four TR repeats. Importantly, in the laboratory, we recovered the TR mutation from a sexual cross between two TR isolates from the same azole-containing compost, possibly through unequal crossing over between the double tandem repeats (TRs) during meiosis. This possible role of sexual reproduction in the emergence of the mutation was further implicated by the high level of genetic diversity of STR genotypes in the azole-containing compost. Our study confirms that azole resistance mutations continue to emerge in the environment and indicates compost containing azole residues as a possible hot spot. Better insight into the biology of environmental resistance selection is needed to retain the azole class for use in food production and treatment of  diseases. Composting of organic matter containing azole residues might be important for resistance development and subsequent spread of resistance mutations in  In this article, we show the dominance of azole-resistant  in azole-exposed compost and the discovery of a new resistance mutation with clinical relevance. Furthermore, our study indicates that current fungicide application is not sustainable as new resistance mutations continue to emerge, thereby threatening the use of triazoles in medicine. We provide evidence that the sexual part of the fungal life cycle may play a role in the emergence of resistance mutations because under laboratory conditions, we reconstructed the resistance mutation through sexual crossing of two azole-resistant  isolates derived from the same compost heap. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance selection in the environment is needed to design strategies against the accumulation of resistance mutations in order to retain the azole class for crop protection and treatment of  diseases."

The systematic characterization of reduced genomes provides valuable insights into the cellular properties that are quantitatively described by the global parameters related to the dynamics of growth and mutation. In the present study, we analyzed a small collection of W3110  derivatives containing either the wild-type genome or reduced genomes of various lengths to examine whether the mutation rate, a global parameter representing genomic plasticity, was affected by genome reduction. We found that the mutation rates of these cells increased with genome reduction. The correlation between genome length and mutation rate, which has been reported for the evolution of bacteria, was also identified, intriguingly, for genome reduction. Gene function enrichment analysis indicated that the deletion of many of the genes encoding membrane and transport proteins play a role in the mutation rate changes mediated by genome reduction. Furthermore, the increase in the mutation rate with genome reduction was highly associated with a decrease in the growth rate in a nutrition-dependent manner; thus, poorer media showed a larger change that was of higher significance. This negative correlation was strongly supported by experimental evidence that the serial transfer of the reduced genome improved the growth rate and reduced the mutation rate to a large extent. Taken together, the global parameters corresponding to the genome, growth, and mutation showed a coordinated relationship, which might be an essential working principle for balancing the cellular dynamics appropriate to the environment. Genome reduction is a powerful approach for investigating the fundamental rules for living systems. Whether genetically disturbed genomes have any specific properties that are different from or similar to those of natively evolved genomes has been under investigation. In the present study, we found that  cells with reduced genomes showed accelerated nucleotide substitution errors (mutation rates), although these cells retained the normal DNA mismatch repair systems. Intriguingly, this finding of correlation between reduced genome size and a higher mutation rate was consistent with the reported evolution of mutation rates. Furthermore, the increased mutation rate was quantitatively associated with a decreased growth rate, indicating that the global parameters related to the genome, growth, and mutation, which represent the amount of genetic information, the efficiency of propagation, and the fidelity of replication, respectively, are dynamically coordinated."

            "#text": "Kin discrimination systems are found in numerous communal contexts like multicellularity and are theorized to prevent exploitation of cooperative behaviors. The kin discrimination system in  differs from most other such systems because it excludes nonkin cells rather than including kin cells. Because nonkin are the target of the system,  can potentially distinguish degrees of nonkin relatedness, not just kin versus nonkin. We examined this by testing a large strain collection of diverse  species against  in different multicellular contexts. The effects of kin discrimination extend to nearby species, as the other  clade species were treated with the same antagonism as nonkin. Species in the less-related  clade started to display varied phenotypes but were mostly still discriminated against, while  clade members and beyond were no longer subject to kin discrimination. Seeking a reason why other species are perceived as antagonistic nonkin, we tested the ability of  to steal communally produced surfactant from these species. We found that the species treated as nonkin were the only ones that made a surfactant that  could utilize and that nonkin antagonism prevented such stealing when the two strains were mixed. The nonkin exclusion kin discrimination method thus allows effective protection of the cooperative behaviors prevalent in multicellularity while still permitting interactions with more distant species that are not a threat. Multicellular systems like bacterial biofilms and swarms rely on cooperative behaviors that could be undermined by exploitative invaders. Discriminating kin from nonkin is one way to help guard against such exploitation but has thus far been examined only intraspecifically, so the phylogenetic range of this important trait is unknown. We tested whether  treats other species as nonkin by testing a single strain against a diverse collection of  isolates. We found that the species in the same clade were treated as nonkin, which then lessened in more distant relatives. Further experiments showed that these nonkin species produced a cooperative good that could be stolen by  and that treating each other as nonkin largely prevented this exploitation. These results impact our understanding of interspecies interactions, as bacterial populations can interact only after they have diverged enough to no longer be a threat to their cooperative existences."

            "#text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne  that has emerged as the cause of encephalitis and fetal microencephaly in the Americas. ZIKV uniquely persists in human bodily fluids for up to 6 months, is sexually transmitted, and traverses the placenta and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to damage neurons. Cells that support persistent ZIKV replication and mechanisms by which ZIKV establishes persistence remain enigmatic but central to ZIKV entry into protected neuronal compartments. The endothelial cell (EC) lining of capillaries normally constrains transplacental transmission and forms the BBB, which selectively restricts access of blood constituents to neurons. We found that ZIKV (strain PRVABC59) persistently infects and continuously replicates in primary human brain microvascular ECs (hBMECs), without cytopathology, for >9 days and following hBMEC passage. ZIKV did not permeabilize hBMECs but was released basolaterally from polarized hBMECs, suggesting a direct mechanism for ZIKV to cross the BBB. ZIKV-infected hBMECs were rapidly resistant to alpha interferon (IFN-α) and transiently induced, but failed to secrete, IFN-β and IFN-λ. Global transcriptome analysis determined that ZIKV constitutively induced IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), IRF9, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) 1 to 9 days postinfection, despite persistently replicating in hBMECs. ZIKV constitutively induced ISG15, HERC5, and USP18, which are linked to hepatitis C virus (HCV) persistence and IFN regulation, chemokine CCL5, which is associated with immunopathogenesis, as well as cell survival factors. Our results reveal that hBMECs act as a reservoir of persistent ZIKV replication, suggest routes for ZIKV to cross hBMECs into neuronal compartments, and define novel mechanisms of ZIKV persistence that can be targeted to restrict ZIKV spread. ZIKV persists in patients, crossing placental and neuronal barriers, damaging neurons, and causing fetal microencephaly. We found that ZIKV persistently infects brain endothelial cells that normally protect neurons from viral exposure. hBMECs are not damaged by ZIKV infection and, analogous to persistent HCV infection, ZIKV constitutively induces and evades antiviral ISG and IFN responses to continuously replicate in hBMECs. As a result, hBMECs provide a protective niche for systemic ZIKV spread and a viral reservoir localized in the normally protective blood-brain barrier. Consistent with the spread of ZIKV into neuronal compartments, ZIKV was released basolaterally from hBMECs. Our findings define hBMEC responses that contribute to persistent ZIKV infection and potential targets for clearing ZIKV infections from hBMECs. These results further suggest roles for additional ZIKV-infected ECs to facilitate viral spread and persistence in the protected placental, retinal, and testicular compartments."

Instead, we show that the increased dosage of Mge1 plays a protective role by retaining increased amounts of ergosterol upon fluconazole treatment.

While some of them remain relatively harmless, infections that reach the bloodstream often become lethal. Only a few therapies are available, and resistance of the pathogen to these drugs is a frequently encountered problem. It is thus essential that more research is performed on how these pathogens cope with the treatment and cause recurrent infections. Baker's yeast is often used as a model to study pathogenic fungi. We show here, by using this model, that iron metabolism and the formation of the important iron-sulfur clusters are involved in regulating susceptibility to fluconazole, the most commonly used antifungal drug.

            "#text": "Among the endemic deep mycoses in Latin America, paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), caused by thermodimorphic fungi of the  genus, is a major cause of morbidity. Disease development and its manifestations are associated with both host and fungal factors. Concerning the latter, several recent studies have employed the methodology of gene modulation in  using antisense RNA (AsRNA) and -mediated transformation (ATMT) to identify proteins that influence fungus virulence. Our previous observations suggested that paracoccin (PCN), a multidomain fungal protein with both lectin and enzymatic activities, may be a potential  virulence factor. To explore this, we used AsRNA and ATMT methodology to obtain three independent PCN-silenced  yeast strains (As, As, and As) and characterized them with regard to  biology and pathogenicity. As, As, and As showed relative PCN expression levels that were 60%, 40%, and 60% of that of the wild-type (WT) strain, respectively. PCN silencing led to the aggregation of fungal cells, blocked the morphological yeast-to-mycelium transition, and rendered the yeast less resistant to macrophage fungicidal activity. In addition, mice infected with As, As, and As showed a reduction in fungal burden of approximately 96% compared with those inoculated with the WT strain, which displayed a more extensive destruction of lung tissue. Finally, mice infected with the PCN-silenced yeast strains had lower mortality than those infected with the WT strain. These data demonstrate that PCN acts as a  contributory virulence factor directly affecting fungal pathogenesis. The nonexistence of efficient genetic transformation systems has hampered studies in the dimorphic fungus , the etiological agent of the most frequent systemic mycosis in Latin America. The recent development of a method for gene expression knockdown by antisense RNA technology, associated with an -mediated transformation system, provides new strategies for studying  Through this technology, we generated yeasts that were silenced for paracoccin (PCN), a  component that has lectin and enzymatic properties. By comparing the phenotypes of PCN-silenced and wild-type strains of , we identified PCN as a virulence factor whose absence renders the yeasts unable to undergo the transition to mycelium and causes a milder pulmonary disease in mice, with a lower mortality rate. Our report highlights the importance of the technology used for  transformation and demonstrates that paracoccin is a virulence factor acting on fungal biology and pathogenesis."

            "#text": "It is generally assumed that the acquisition of antibiotic resistance is associated with a fitness cost. We have shown that overexpression of the MexEF-OprN efflux pump does not decrease the fitness of a resistant  strain compared to its wild-type counterpart. This lack of fitness cost was associated with a metabolic rewiring that includes increased expression of the anaerobic nitrate respiratory chain when cells are growing under fully aerobic conditions. It was not clear whether this metabolic compensation was exclusive to strains overexpressing MexEF-OprN or if it extended to other resistant strains that overexpress similar systems. To answer this question, we studied a set of  mutants that independently overexpress the MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, or MexXY efflux pumps. We observed increased expression of the anaerobic nitrate respiratory chain in all cases, with a concomitant increase in NO consumption and NO production. These efflux pumps are proton/substrate antiporters, and their overexpression may lead to intracellular H accumulation, which may in turn offset the pH homeostasis. Indeed, all studied mutants showed a decrease in intracellular pH under anaerobic conditions. The fastest way to eliminate the excess of protons is by increasing oxygen consumption, a feature also displayed by all analyzed mutants. Taken together, our results support metabolic rewiring as a general mechanism to avoid the fitness costs derived from overexpression of  multidrug efflux pumps. The development of drugs that block this metabolic \"reaccommodation\" might help in reducing the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance elements among bacterial populations. It is widely accepted that the acquisition of resistance confers a fitness cost in such a way that in the absence of antibiotics, resistant populations will be outcompeted by susceptible ones. Based on this assumption, antibiotic cycling regimes have been proposed in the belief that they will reduce the persistence and spread of resistance among bacterial pathogens. Unfortunately, trials testing this possibility have frequently failed, indicating that resistant microorganisms are not always outcompeted by susceptible ones. Indeed, some mutations do not result in a fitness cost, and in case they do, the cost may be compensated for by a secondary mutation. Here we describe an alternative nonmutational mechanism for compensating for fitness costs, which consists of the metabolic rewiring of resistant mutants. Deciphering the mechanisms involved in the compensation of fitness costs of antibiotic-resistant mutants may help in the development of drugs that will reduce the persistence of resistance by increasing said costs."

            "#text": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can have profound effects on bacterial evolution by allowing individuals to rapidly acquire adaptive traits that shape their strategies for competition. One strategy for intermicrobial antagonism often used by  is the genetically encoded contact-dependent type VI secretion system (T6SS), a weapon used to kill heteroclonal neighbors by direct injection of toxic effectors. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that  can acquire new T6SS effector genes via horizontal transfer and utilize them to kill neighboring cells. Replacement of one or more parental alleles with novel effectors allows the recombinant strain to dramatically outcompete its parent. Using spatially explicit modeling, we examine how this process could affect the ecology and evolution of surface-attached microbial populations. HGT of T6SS effector-immunity pairs is risky: transformation brings a cell into conflict with its former clone mates but can be adaptive when superior T6SS alleles are acquired. More generally, we find that these costs and benefits are not symmetric and that high rates of HGT can act as a hedge against competitors with unpredictable T6SS efficacy. We conclude that antagonism and horizontal transfer drive successive rounds of weapon optimization and selective sweeps, dynamically shaping the composition of microbial communities. The contact-dependent type VI secretion system (T6SS) is frequently used by  to kill adjacent competitors. While DNA released by T6 killing can be horizontally acquired, it remains untested whether T6 genes themselves can be horizontally acquired and then utilized to compete with neighboring cells. Using naturally transformable , we provide the first direct empirical support for the hypothesis that T6 genes are exchanged horizontally (e.g., from dead competitors) and functionally deployed to compete with neighboring cells. Using computational simulations, we also demonstrate that high rates of HGT can be adaptive, allowing  to improve upon existing T6 weaponry and survive direct encounters with otherwise superior competitors. We anticipate that our evolutionary results are of broad microbiological relevance, applying to many bacteria capable of HGT that utilize the T6SS or similar antagonistic systems, and highlight the profound impact of HGT in shaping microbial community structure."

            "#text": "The disaccharide trehalose is critical to the survival of pathogenic fungi in their human host. Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1) catalyzes the first step of trehalose biosynthesis in fungi. Here, we report the first structures of eukaryotic Tps1s in complex with substrates or substrate analogues. The overall structures of Tps1 from  and  are essentially identical and reveal N- and C-terminal Rossmann fold domains that form the glucose-6-phosphate and UDP-glucose substrate binding sites, respectively. These Tps1 structures with substrates or substrate analogues reveal key residues involved in recognition and catalysis. Disruption of these key residues severely impaired Tps1 enzymatic activity. Subsequent cellular analyses also highlight the enzymatic function of Tps1 in thermotolerance, yeast-hypha transition, and biofilm development. These results suggest that Tps1 enzymatic functionality is essential for the fungal stress response and virulence. Furthermore, structures of Tps1 in complex with the nonhydrolyzable inhibitor, validoxylamine A, visualize the transition state and support an internal return-like catalytic mechanism that is generalizable to other GT-B-fold retaining glycosyltransferases. Collectively, our results depict key Tps1-substrate interactions, unveil the enzymatic mechanism of these fungal proteins, and pave the way for high-throughput inhibitor screening buttressed and guided by the current structures and those of high-affinity ligand-Tps1 complexes. Invasive fungal diseases have emerged as major threats, resulting in more than 1.5 million deaths annually worldwide. This epidemic has been further complicated by increasing resistance to all major classes of antifungal drugs in the clinic. Trehalose biosynthesis is essential for the fungal stress response and virulence. Critically, this biosynthetic pathway is absent in mammals, and thus, the two enzymes that carry out trehalose biosynthesis, namely, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (Tps2), are prominent targets for antifungal intervention. Here, we report the first eukaryotic Tps1 structures from the pathogenic fungi  and  in complex with substrates, substrate analogues, and inhibitors. These structures reveal key protein-substrate interactions, providing atomic-level scaffolds for structure-guided drug design of novel antifungals that target Tps1."

            "#text": "Many proteobacteria utilize acyl-homoserine lactone quorum-sensing signals. At low population densities, cells produce a basal level of signal, and when sufficient signal has accumulated in the surrounding environment, it binds to its receptor, and quorum-sensing-dependent genes can be activated. A common characteristic of acyl-homoserine lactone quorum sensing is that signal production is positively autoregulated. We have examined the role of positive signal autoregulation in  We compared population responses and individual cell responses in populations of wild-type  to responses in a strain with the signal synthase gene controlled by an arabinose-inducible promoter so that signal was produced at a constant rate per cell regardless of cell population density. At a population level, responses of the wild type and the engineered strain were indistinguishable, but the responses of individual cells in a population of the wild type showed greater synchrony than the responses of the engineered strain. Although sufficient signal is required to activate expression of quorum-sensing-regulated genes, it is not sufficient for activation of certain genes, the late genes, and their expression is delayed until other conditions are met. We found that late gene responses were reduced in the engineered strain. We conclude that positive signal autoregulation is not a required element in acyl-homoserine lactone quorum sensing, but it functions to enhance synchrony of the responses of individuals in a population. Synchrony might be advantageous in some situations, whereas a less coordinated quorum-sensing response might allow bet hedging and be advantageous in other situations. There are many quorum-sensing systems that involve a transcriptional activator, which responds to an acyl-homoserine lactone signal. In all of the examples studied, the gene coding for signal production is positively autoregulated by the signal, and it has even been described as essential for a quorum-sensing response. We have used the opportunistic pathogen  as a model to show that positive autoregulation is not required for a robust quorum-sensing response. We also show that positive autoregulation of signal production enhances the synchrony of the response. This information enhances our general understanding of the biological significance of how acyl-homoserine lactone quorum-sensing circuits are arranged."

L7Ae is an essential archaeal protein that is known to structure ribosomal RNAs and small RNAs (sRNAs) by binding to their kink-turn motifs. Here, we utilized RIP-Seq methodology to achieve a first global analysis of RNA substrates for L7Ae. Several novel interactions with noncoding RNA molecules (e.g., with the universal signal recognition particle RNA) were discovered. In addition, L7Ae was found to bind to mRNAs, including its own transcript's 5' untranslated region. This feedback-loop control is conserved in most archaea and was incorporated into a reporter system that was utilized to control gene expression in bacteria. These results demonstrate that L7Ae-mediated gene regulation evolved originally in archaeal organisms. The feedback-controlled reporter gene system can easily be adapted for synthetic biology approaches that require strict gene expression control."

NCR peptides are essential for a successful symbiosis in legume plants of the inverted-repeat-lacking clade (IRLC) and show similarity to mammalian defensins. In addition to signaling functions, many NCR peptides exhibit antimicrobial activity  and  Bacterial resistance to these antimicrobial activities is likely to be important for symbiosis. However, the mechanisms used by  to resist antimicrobial activity of plant peptides are poorly understood. To address this, we applied a global genetic approach using transposon mutagenesis followed by high-throughput sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify  genes and pathways that increase or decrease bacterial competitiveness during exposure to the well-studied cationic NCR247 peptide and also to the unrelated model antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B. We identified 78 genes and several diverse pathways whose interruption alters  resistance to NCR247. These genes encode the following: (i) cell envelope polysaccharide biosynthesis and modification proteins, (ii) inner and outer membrane proteins, (iii) peptidoglycan (PG) effector proteins, and (iv) non-membrane-associated factors such as transcriptional regulators and ribosome-associated factors. We describe a previously uncharacterized yet highly conserved peptidase, which protects  from NCR247 and increases competitiveness during symbiosis. Additionally, we highlight a considerable number of uncharacterized genes that provide the basis for future studies to investigate the molecular basis of symbiotic development as well as chronic pathogenic interactions. Soil rhizobial bacteria enter into an ecologically and economically important symbiotic interaction with legumes, in which they differentiate into physiologically distinct bacteroids that provide essential ammonia to the plant in return for carbon sources. Plant signal peptides are essential and specific to achieve these physiological changes. These peptides show similarity to mammalian defensin peptides which are part of the first line of defense to control invading bacterial populations. A number of these legume peptides are indeed known to possess antimicrobial activity, and so far, only the bacterial BacA protein is known to protect rhizobial bacteria against their antimicrobial action. This study identified numerous additional bacterial factors that mediate protection and belong to diverse biological pathways. Our results significantly contribute to our understanding of the molecular roles of bacterial factors during legume symbioses and, second, provide insights into the mechanisms that pathogenic bacteria may use to resist the antimicrobial effects of defensins during infections."

            "#text": "Bacterial cells, like many other organisms, face a tradeoff between longevity and fecundity. Planktonic cells are fast growing and fragile, while biofilm cells are often slower growing but stress resistant. Here we ask why bacterial lineages invest simultaneously in both fast- and slow-growing types. We develop a population dynamic model of lineage expansion across a patchy environment and find that mixed investment is favored across a broad range of environmental conditions, even when transmission is entirely via biofilm cells. This mixed strategy is favored because of a division of labor where exponentially dividing planktonic cells can act as an engine for the production of future biofilm cells, which grow more slowly. We use experimental evolution to test our predictions and show that phenotypic heterogeneity is persistent even under selection for purely planktonic or purely biofilm transmission. Furthermore, simulations suggest that maintenance of a biofilm subpopulation serves as a cost-effective hedge against environmental uncertainty, which is also consistent with our experimental findings. Cell types specialized for survival have been observed and described within clonal bacterial populations for decades, but why are these specialists continually produced under benign conditions when such investment comes at a high reproductive cost? Conversely, when survival becomes an imperative, does it ever benefit the population to maintain a pool of rapidly growing but vulnerable planktonic cells? Using a combination of mathematical modeling, simulations, and experiments, we find that mixed investment strategies are favored over a broad range of environmental conditions and rely on a division of labor between cell types, where reproductive specialists amplify survival specialists, which can be transmitted through the environment with a limited mortality rate. We also show that survival specialists benefit rapidly growing populations by serving as a hedge against unpredictable changes in the environment. These results help to clarify the general evolutionary and ecological forces that can generate and maintain diverse subtypes within clonal bacterial populations."

            "#text": "Understanding the genetic basis of host shifts is a key genomic question for pathogen and parasite biology. The  group, which encompasses  and , contains pathogens that can infect insects, nematodes, and vertebrates. Since the target range of the essential virulence factors (Cry toxins) and many isolates is well known, this group presents a powerful system for investigating how pathogens can diversify and adapt to phylogenetically distant hosts. Specialization to exploit insects occurs at the level of the major clade and is associated with substantial changes in the core genome, and host switching between insect orders has occurred repeatedly within subclades. The transfer of plasmids with linked  genes may account for much of the adaptation to particular insect orders, and network analysis implies that host specialization has produced strong associations between key toxin genes with similar targets. Analysis of the distribution of plasmid minireplicons shows that plasmids with  and , which carry genes encoding toxins against Lepidoptera or Diptera, were contained only by  in the specialized insect clade (clade 2), indicating that tight genome/plasmid associations have been important in adaptation to invertebrate hosts. Moreover, the accumulation of multiple virulence factors on transposable elements suggests that cotransfer of diverse virulence factors is advantageous in terms of expanding the insecticidal spectrum, overcoming insect resistance, or through gains in pathogenicity via synergistic interactions between toxins. Population genomics have provided many new insights into the formation, evolution, and dynamics of bacterial pathogens of humans and other higher animals, but these pathogens usually have very narrow host ranges. As a pathogen of insects and nematodes, , which produces toxins showing toxicity to many orders of insects and other invertebrates, can be used as a model to study the evolution of pathogens with wide host ranges. Phylogenomic analysis revealed that host specialization and switching occur at the level of the major clade and subclade, respectively. A toxin gene co-occurrence network indicates that multiple toxins with similar targets were accumulated by the same cell in the whole species. This accumulation may be one of the strategies that  has used to fight against host resistance. This kind of formation and evolution of pathogens represents a different path used against multiple invertebrate hosts from that used against higher animals."

While some individuals are asymptomatic  carriers, symptomatic disease ranges from mild diarrhea to potentially lethal toxic megacolon. The wide disease spectrum has been attributed to the infected host's age, underlying diseases, immune status, and microbiome composition. However, strain-specific differences in  virulence have also been implicated in determining colitis severity. Because patients infected with  are unique in terms of medical history, microbiome composition, and immune competence, determining the relative contribution of  virulence to disease severity has been challenging, and conclusions regarding the virulence of specific strains have been inconsistent. To address this, we used a mouse model to test 33 clinical  strains isolated from patients with disease severities ranging from asymptomatic carriage to severe colitis, and we determined their relative  virulence in genetically identical, antibiotic-pretreated mice. We found that murine infections with  clade 2 strains (including multilocus sequence type 1/ribotype 027) were associated with higher lethality and that  strains associated with greater human disease severity caused more severe disease in mice. While toxin production was not strongly correlated with  colonic pathology, the ability of  strains to grow in the presence of secondary bile acids was associated with greater disease severity. Whole-genome sequencing and identification of core and accessory genes identified a subset of accessory genes that distinguish high-virulence from lower-virulence  strains. is an important cause of hospital-associated intestinal infections, and recent years have seen an increase in the number and severity of cases in the United States. A patient's antibiotic history, immune status, and medical comorbidities determine, in part, the severity of  infection. The relative virulence of different clinical  strains, although postulated to determine disease severity in patients, has been more difficult to consistently associate with mild versus severe colitis. We tested 33 distinct clinical  isolates for their ability to cause disease in genetically identical mice and found that  strains belonging to clade 2 were associated with higher mortality. Differences in survival were not attributed to differences in toxin production but likely resulted from the distinct gene content in the various clinical isolates."

In this study, we describe a novel  factor that has a vital role in chromosome replication and the regulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear mitotic structures, and we named this factor ECR1 for essential for chromosome replication 1. ECR1 was discovered by complementation of a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant that suffers lethal, uncontrolled chromosome replication at 40°C similar to a ts mutant carrying a defect in topoisomerase. ECR1 is a 52-kDa protein containing divergent RING and TRAF-Sina-like zinc binding domains that are dynamically expressed in the tachyzoite cell cycle. ECR1 first appears in the unique spindle compartment of the  (centrocone) of the nuclear envelope in early S phase and then in the nucleus in late S phase where it reaches maximum expression. Following nuclear division, but before daughter parasites separate from the mother parasite, ECR1 is downregulated and is absent in new daughter parasites. The proteomics of ECR1 identified interactions with the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation machinery and the minichromosome maintenance complex, and the loss of ECR1 led to increased stability of a key member of this complex, MCM2. ECR1 also forms a stable complex with the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-related kinase,  Crk5 (TgCrk5), which displays a similar cell cycle expression and localization during tachyzoite replication. Importantly, the localization of ECR1/TgCrk5 in the centrocone indicates that this -specific spindle compartment houses important regulatory factors that control the parasite cell cycle. Parasites of the apicomplexan family are important causes of human disease, including malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. Parasite growth is the underlying cause of pathogenesis, yet despite this importance, the molecular basis for parasite replication is poorly understood. Filling this knowledge gap cannot be accomplished by mining recent whole-genome sequencing data because apicomplexan cell cycles differ substantially and lack many of the key regulatory factors of well-studied yeast and mammalian cell division models. We have utilized forward genetics to discover essential factors that regulate cell division in these parasites using the  model. An example of this approach is described here with the discovery of a putative E3 ligase/protein kinase mechanism involved in regulating chromosome replication and mitotic processes of asexual stage parasites."

Amebic trogocytosis is required for cell killing and contributes to tissue invasion, which is a hallmark of invasive amebic colitis. Work done prior to the discovery of amebic trogocytosis showed that acid vesicles are required for amebic cytotoxicity. In the present study, we show that acidified lysosomes are required for amebic trogocytosis and cell killing. Interference with lysosome acidification using ammonium chloride, a weak base, or concanamycin A, a vacuolar H ATPase inhibitor, decreased amebic trogocytosis and amebic cytotoxicity. Our data suggest that the inhibitors do not impair the ingestion of an initial fragment but rather block continued trogocytosis and the ingestion of multiple fragments. The acidification inhibitors also decreased phagocytosis, but not fluid-phase endocytosis. These data suggest that amebic lysosomes play a crucial role in amebic trogocytosis, phagocytosis, and cell killing. is a protozoan parasite that is prevalent in low-income countries, where it causes potentially fatal diarrhea, dysentery, and liver abscesses. Tissue destruction is a hallmark of invasive  infection. The parasite is highly cytotoxic to a wide range of human cells, and parasite cytotoxic activity is likely to drive tissue destruction.  is able to kill human cells through amebic trogocytosis. This process also contributes to tissue invasion. Trogocytosis has been observed in other organisms; however, little is known about the mechanism in any system. We show that interference with lysosomal acidification impairs amebic trogocytosis, phagocytosis, and cell killing, indicating that amebic lysosomes are critically important for these processes."

These errors occur at rates that are orders of magnitude higher than rates during DNA replication, but due to technical difficulties such measurements have been limited to single-base substitutions and have not yet quantified the scope of transcription insertions and deletions. Previous reporter gene assay findings suggested that transcription indels are produced exclusively by elongation complex slippage at homopolymeric runs, so we enumerated indels across the protein-coding transcriptomes of  and , which differ widely in their genomic base compositions and incidence of repeat regions. As anticipated from prior assays, transcription insertions prevailed in homopolymeric runs of A and T; however, transcription deletions arose in much more complex sequences and were rarely associated with homopolymeric runs. By reconstructing the relocated positions of the elongation complex as inferred from the sequences inserted or deleted during transcription, we show that continuation of transcription after slippage hinges on the degree of nucleotide complementarity within the RNA:DNA hybrid at the new DNA template location. The high level of mistakes generated during transcription can result in the accumulation of malfunctioning and misfolded proteins which can alter global gene regulation and in the expenditure of energy to degrade these nonfunctional proteins. The transcriptome-wide occurrence of base substitutions has been elucidated in bacteria, but information on transcription insertions and deletions-errors that potentially have more dire effects on protein function-is limited to reporter gene constructs. Here, we capture the transcriptome-wide spectrum of insertions and deletions in  and  and show that they occur at rates approaching those of base substitutions. Knowledge of the full extent of sequences subject to transcription indels supports a new model of bacterial transcription slippage, one that relies on the number of complementary bases between the transcript and the DNA template to which it slipped."

Here, we investigated the constraints on transfer of a gene encoding a highly conserved informational protein, translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), by systematically replacing the endogenous  gene in the  genome with its extant and ancestral homologs. The extant homologs represented  variants from both near and distant homologous organisms. The ancestral homologs represented phylogenetically resurrected  sequences dating from 0.7 to 3.6 billion years ago (bya). Our results demonstrate that all of the foreign  genes are transferable to the  genome, provided that an additional copy of the EF-Tu gene, , remains present in the  genome. However, when the  gene was removed, only the variants obtained from the gammaproteobacterial family (extant and ancestral) supported growth which demonstrates the limited functional interchangeability of  with its homologs. Relative bacterial fitness correlated with the evolutionary distance of the extant  homologs inserted into the  genome. This reduced fitness was associated with reduced levels of EF-Tu and reduced rates of protein synthesis. Increasing the expression of  partially ameliorated these fitness costs. In summary, our analysis suggests that the functional conservation of protein activity, the amount of protein expressed, and its network connectivity act to constrain the successful transfer of this essential gene into foreign bacteria. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a fundamental driving force in bacterial evolution. However, whether essential genes can be acquired by HGT and whether they can be acquired from distant organisms are very poorly understood. By systematically replacing  with ancestral homologs and homologs from distantly related organisms, we investigated the constraints on HGT of a highly conserved gene with multiple interaction partners.

            "#text": "Telomeres, the ends of the eukaryotic chromosomes, help to maintain the genome's integrity and thus play important roles in aging and cancer. Telomere length is strictly controlled in all organisms. In humans, telomeres shorten with age, and it has been proposed that telomere shortening may play a causal role in aging. We took advantage of the availability of yeast strains with genetically or physiologically generated differences in telomere length to measure the effect that telomere length may have on cellular growth. By comparing the growth rates affecting telomere length of various yeast mutants we show that there is no correlation between their telomere length and cellular fitness. We also show that wild-type yeast cells carrying extremely long telomeres (~5 times longer than the average) showed no signs of mitotic or meiotic defects, and competition experiments found no differences in growth between strains with normal telomeres and strains with long telomeres. No advantage or disadvantage of cells with long telomeres was detected under stress conditions either. Finally, telomere length had no effect in a chronological life span assay, which measures survival of post-mitotic-stage cells. We conclude that extreme telomere length has no effects (positive or negative) on the fitness of yeast cells. Telomeres protect the chromosomal ends from fusion, degradation, and unwanted repair. Therefore, telomeres preserve genome stability and cell viability. In humans, telomeres shorten with each cell duplication event and with age. It has thus been proposed that telomere shortening may be responsible for human aging and that elongation of telomeres may be a way to rejuvenate cells and to combat aging. However, it is difficult to prove this hypothesis in human cells. Yeasts are easy to manipulate and have telomeres whose length is strictly maintained. Here we show that yeast cells manipulated to have extremely long telomeres (~5-fold those of normal cells) did not show any improvement or reduction in fitness compared to otherwise identical cells with telomeres of normal length under all the conditions tested. Moreover, an assay that measures cell aging showed no effect of the presence of extremely long telomeres. We thus conclude that extreme telomere length, at least in yeast cells, does not affect cellular fitness, aging, or senescence."

Expression studies with quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, Western blotting, and  fusions demonstrated that CsrA represses  expression. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified four CsrA binding sites in the  leader transcript, all of which are far upstream of the  ribosome binding site. Computational modeling and RNA structure mapping identified an RNA structure that sequesters the  Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. Three open reading frames (ORFs), all of which are translated, were identified in the  leader region. Two of these ORFs do not affect  expression. However, the translation initiation region of the third ORF contains three of the CsrA binding sites, one of which overlaps its SD sequence. Furthermore, the ORF stop codon overlaps the  start codon, a sequence arrangement indicative of translational coupling.  expression and  translation studies with wild-type and mutant reporter fusions demonstrated that bound CsrA directly represses translation initiation of this ORF. We further established that CsrA-dependent repression of  translation occurs entirely via translational coupling with this ORF, leading to accelerated  mRNA decay. CsrA posttranscriptionally represses gene expression associated with stationary-phase bacterial growth, often in opposition to the transcriptional effects of the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS. We show that CsrA employs a novel regulatory mechanism to repress translation of , which encodes an antiadapter protein that protects RpoS against proteolysis. CsrA binds to four sites in the  leader transcript but does not directly occlude ribosome binding to the  SD sequence. Instead, CsrA represses translation of a short open reading frame encoded upstream of , causing repression of  translation via translational coupling. This finding offers a novel mechanism of gene regulation by the global regulator CsrA, and since RpoS can activate  transcription, this also highlights a new negative-feedback loop within the complex Csr and RpoS circuitry."

Using , an emerging model organism for assessing evolutionary processes, we report that pyruvate is in the vanguard of molecules that scavenge heat-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). We show that, as well as inducing a rapid burst of ROS production, heat stress also downregulates genes for pyruvate consumption. The accumulating pyruvate is the fastest acting of several  ROS scavengers, efficiently reducing protein carbonylation, stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential, and promoting fungal growth. The acetate produced from pyruvate-ROS reactions itself causes acid stress, tolerance to which is regulated by Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Heat stress also induces pyruvate accumulation in several other fungi, suggesting that scavenging of heat-induced ROS by pyruvate is widespread. Heat is a dangerous challenge for most organisms, as it denatures proteins and induces the production of ROS that inactivate proteins, lipid membranes, and DNA. How organisms respond to this stress is not fully understood. Using the experimentally tractable insect pathogen  as a model organism, we show for the first time that heat stress induces pyruvate production and that this functions as the first line of defense against heat-induced ROS. Heat stress also induces rapid pyruvate accumulation in other fungi, suggesting that pyruvate is a common but unappreciated defense against stress."

Here, we extend the transformation-associated recombination cloning and heterologous expression platform for microbial BGCs to include Gram-negative proteobacterial expression hosts. Using a broad-host-range expression platform, we test the implicit assumption that biosynthetic pathways are more successfully expressed in more closely related heterologous hosts. Cloning and expression of the violacein BGC from  2ta16 revealed robust production in two proteobacterial hosts,  KT2440 and  LBA4404, but very little production of the antibiotic in various laboratory strains of , despite their closer phylogenetic relationship. We identified a nonclustered LuxR-type quorum-sensing receptor from  2ta16, PviR, that increases pathway transcription and violacein production in  by ∼60-fold independently of acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducers. Although  harbors the most similar homolog of PviR identified from all of the hosts tested, overexpression of various  transcription factors did not result in a statistically significant increase in violacein production, while overexpression of two  PviR homologs significantly increased production. Thus, this work not only introduces a new genetic platform for the heterologous expression of microbial BGCs, it also challenges the assumption that host phylogeny is an accurate predictor of host compatibility. Although Gram-positive heterologous hosts such as  have been developed and optimized to support diverse secondary metabolic reactions, there has been comparatively less work on Gram-negative hosts, some of which grow faster and are easier to work with. This work presents a new genetic platform for direct cloning and broad-host-range heterologous expression of BGCs in Gram-negative proteobacterial expression hosts, and we leverage this platform to uncover regulatory elements that influence violacein expression from  Although it is often assumed that BGCs will be more successfully expressed in more closely related hosts, our work suggests that this may not be a general rule of thumb, as heterologous production of natural products can be influenced by specific host regulatory and/or biosynthetic elements, and the identity and effectiveness of those elements are difficult to predict. We argue for the use of a diverse set of heterologous hosts, which may also provide insights into the BGC biosynthetic mechanism and the biological function of BGCs."

            "#text": "The bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) is a nearly ubiquitous intracellular signaling molecule involved in the transition from the motile to the sessile/biofilm state in bacteria. C-di-GMP regulates various cellular processes, including biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. BolA is a transcription factor that promotes survival in different stresses and is also involved in biofilm formation. Both BolA and c-di-GMP participate in the regulation of motility mechanisms leading to similar phenotypes. Here, we establish the importance of the balance between these two factors for accurate regulation of the transition between the planktonic and sessile lifestyles. This balance is achieved by negative-feedback regulation of BolA and c-di-GMP. BolA not only contributes directly to the motility of bacteria but also regulates the expression of diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases. This expression modulation influences the synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP, while this signaling metabolite has a negative influence in  mRNA transcription. Finally, we present evidence of the dominant role of BolA in biofilm, showing that, even in the presence of elevated c-di-GMP levels, biofilm formation is reduced in the absence of BolA. C-di-GMP is one of the most important bacterial second messengers involved in several cellular processes, including virulence, cell cycle regulation, biofilm formation, and flagellar synthesis. In this study, we unravelled a direct connection between the  morphogene and the c-di-GMP signaling molecule. We show the important cross-talk that occurs between these two molecular regulators during the transition between the motile/planktonic and adhesive/sessile lifestyles in  This work provides important clues that can be helpful in the development of new strategies, and the results can be applied to other organisms with relevance for human health. Bacterial cells have evolved several mechanisms to cope with environmental stresses. BolA-like proteins are widely conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and in , in addition to its pleiotropic effects, this protein plays a determinant role in bacterial motility and biofilm formation regulation. Similarly, the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP is a molecule with high importance in coordinating the switch between planktonic and sessile life in bacteria. Here we have unravelled the importance of accurate regulation of cross-talk between BolA and c-di-GMP for a proper response in the regulation of these bacterial lifestyles. This finding underlines the complexity of bacterial cell regulation, revealing the existence of one additional tool for fine-tuning such important cellular molecular mechanisms. The relationship between BolA and c-di-GMP gives new perspectives regarding biofilm formation and opens the possibility to extend our studies to other organisms with relevance for human health."

            "#text": "During its lysogenic life cycle, the phage genome is integrated into the host chromosome by site-specific recombination. In this report, we analyze lambda phage integration into noncanonical sites using next-generation sequencing and show that it generates significant genetic diversity by targeting over 300 unique sites in the host  genome. Moreover, these integration events can have important phenotypic consequences for the host, including changes in cell motility and increased antibiotic resistance. Importantly, the new technologies that we developed to enable this study-sequencing secondary sites using next-generation sequencing and then selecting relevant lysogens using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-based selection-are broadly applicable to other phage-bacterium systems. Bacteriophages play an important role in bacterial evolution through lysogeny, where the phage genome is integrated into the host chromosome. While phage integration generally occurs at a specific site in the host chromosome, it is also known to occur at other, so-called secondary sites. In this study, we developed a new experimental technology to comprehensively study secondary integration sites and discovered that phage can integrate into over 300 unique sites in the host genome, resulting in significant genetic diversity in bacteria. We further developed an assay to examine the phenotypic consequence of such diverse integration events and found that phage integration can cause changes in evolutionarily relevant traits such as bacterial motility and increases in antibiotic resistance. Importantly, our method is readily applicable to other phage-bacterium systems."

When BvgS is inactive and BvgA is not phosphorylated, virulence-repressed genes (s) are induced [Bvg(-) mode]. Here, we have used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to define the BvgAS-dependent regulon of  Tohama I.

BvgA-activated genes include those encoding two-component systems (such as ), multiple other transcriptional regulators, and the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor , which is needed for type 3 secretion system (T3SS) expression, further establishing the importance of BvgA~P as an apex regulator of transcriptional networks promoting virulence.

Within the past 20 years, outbreaks of whooping cough, caused by , have led to respiratory disease and infant mortalities, despite good vaccination coverage. This is due, at least in part, to the introduction of a less effective acellular vaccine in the 1990s. It is crucial, then, to understand the molecular basis of  growth and infection. The two-component system BvgA (response regulator)/BvgS (histidine kinase) is the master regulator of  virulence genes. We report here the first RNA-seq analysis of the BvgAS regulon in , revealing that more than 550 genes are regulated by BvgAS. We show that genes for multiple and varied metabolic pathways are highly regulated in the Bvg(-) mode (absence of BvgA phosphorylation).

            "#text": "The bacterial second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) ubiquitously promotes bacterial biofilm formation. Intracellular pools of c-di-GMP seem to be dynamically negotiated by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs, with GGDEF domains) and specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs, with EAL or HD-GYP domains). Most bacterial species possess multiple DGCs and PDEs, often with surprisingly distinct and specific output functions. One explanation for such specificity is \"local\" c-di-GMP signaling, which is believed to involve direct interactions between specific DGC/PDE pairs and c-di-GMP-binding effector/target systems. Here we present a systematic analysis of direct protein interactions among all 29 GGDEF/EAL domain proteins of  Since the effects of interactions depend on coexpression and stoichiometries, cellular levels of all GGDEF/EAL domain proteins were also quantified and found to vary dynamically along the growth cycle. Instead of detecting specific pairs of interacting DGCs and PDEs, we discovered a tightly interconnected protein network of a specific subset or \"supermodule\" of DGCs and PDEs with a coregulated core of five hyperconnected hub proteins. These include the DGC/PDE proteins representing the c-di-GMP switch that turns on biofilm matrix production in  Mutants lacking these core hub proteins show drastic biofilm-related phenotypes but no changes in cellular c-di-GMP levels. Overall, our results provide the basis for a novel model of local c-di-GMP signaling in which a single strongly expressed master PDE, PdeH, dynamically eradicates global effects of several DGCs by strongly draining the global c-di-GMP pool and thereby restricting these DGCs to serving as local c-di-GMP sources that activate specific colocalized effector/target systems. c-di-GMP signaling in bacteria is believed to occur via changes in cellular c-di-GMP levels controlled by antagonistic and potentially interacting pairs of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Our systematic analysis of protein-protein interaction patterns of all 29 GGDEF/EAL domain proteins of , together with our measurements of cellular c-di-GMP levels, challenges both aspects of this current concept. Knocking out distinct DGCs and PDEs has drastic effects on  biofilm formation without changing the cellular c-di-GMP level. In addition, rather than generally coming in interacting DGC/PDE pairs, a subset of DGCs and PDEs operates as central interaction hubs in a larger \"supermodule,\" with other DGCs and PDEs behaving as \"lonely players\" without contacts to other c-di-GMP-related enzymes. On the basis of these data, we propose a novel concept of \"local\" c-di-GMP signaling in bacteria with multiple enzymes that make or break the second messenger c-di-GMP."

This secretion process therefore requires specific gating, interacting, and dynamics properties mainly operated by a bipartite outer membrane channel called secretin. We have a good understanding of the structure-function relationship of the pore-forming C-terminal domain of secretins. In contrast, the high flexibility of their periplasmic N-terminal domain has been an obstacle in obtaining the detailed structural information required to uncover its molecular function. In , the Xcp T2SS plays an important role in bacterial virulence by its capacity to deliver a large panel of toxins and degradative enzymes into the surrounding environment. Here, we revealed that the N-terminal domain of XcpQ secretin spontaneously self-assembled into a hexamer of dimers independently of its C-terminal domain. Furthermore, and by using multidisciplinary approaches, we elucidate the structural organization of the XcpQ N domain and demonstrate that secretin flexibility at interdimer interfaces is mandatory for its function. Bacterial secretins are large homooligomeric proteins constituting the outer membrane pore-forming element of several envelope-embedded nanomachines essential in bacterial survival and pathogenicity. They comprise a well-defined membrane-embedded C-terminal domain and a modular periplasmic N-terminal domain involved in substrate recruitment and connection with inner membrane components. We are studying the XcpQ secretin of the T2SS present in the pathogenic bacterium  Our data highlight the ability of the XcpQ N-terminal domain to spontaneously oligomerize into a hexamer of dimers. Further  experiments revealed that this domain adopts different conformations essential for the T2SS secretion process. These findings provide new insights into the functional understanding of bacterial T2SS secretins."

An integrated network of red/far-red- and blue-light-responsive photosensory proteins is known to inhibit swarming motility in the foliar plant pathogen  pv. syringae B728a. Here we elucidated factors in the red/far-red-light-sensing bacteriophytochrome BphP1 signal transduction pathway and report evidence for a role of BphP1 in multiple stages of the  B728a life cycle. We report that BphP1 signaling involves the downstream regulator Bsi (bacteriophytochrome-regulated swarming inhibitor) and an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal. Loss of  or  resulted in the early initiation of swarm tendrils during swarming motility, a phenotype that was dependent on red/far-red light and reversed by exogenous AHL, illustrating that the BphP1-Bsi-AHL pathway inhibits the transition from a sessile state to a motile state. Loss of  or  resulted in larger water-soaked lesions induced on bean () pods and enhanced movement from soil and buried plant tissues to seeds, demonstrating that BphP1 and Bsi negatively regulate virulence and bacterial movement through soil to seeds. Moreover, BphP1, but not Bsi, contributed to leaf colonization; loss of  reduced survival on leaves immediately following inoculation but enhanced the size of the subsequently established populations. Neither Bsi nor Smp, a swarm motility-promoting regulator identified here, affected leaf colonization, indicating that BphP1-mediated contributions to leaf colonization are, at least in part, independent of swarming motility. These results demonstrate that  B728a red-light sensing involves a multicomponent, branched regulatory pathway that affects several stages of its life cycle. Microbes on plants are particularly well positioned to exploit light cues based on the importance of light to plant growth. Photosensory proteins enable organisms to sense light and respond to light, but their roles in the life cycles of plant microbes are poorly understood. This study investigated the cellular components and ecological roles of red/far-red-light sensing in the foliar bacterial pathogen  The study demonstrated that a bacteriophytochrome photosensory protein functions via a multicomponent, branched regulatory pathway that operates primarily through red/far-red-light-mediated inhibition. This pathway negatively regulates the transition from sessile to motile states under conditions conducive to swarming motility. It also negatively regulates virulence on bean pods, movement through soil to seeds, and survival following inoculation on leaves, but it positively contributes to the eventual establishment of leaf-borne populations. These results provide strong evidence that light sensing modulates behaviors at multiple stages in the life cycle of a nonphotosynthetic, plant microbe."

            "#text": "A significant number of infants acquire HIV-1 through their infected mother's breast milk, primarily due to limited access to antiretrovirals. Passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) may prevent this transmission. Previous studies, however, have generated conflicting results about the ability of nAbs to halt mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and their impact on infant outcomes. This study compared plasma neutralizing activity in exposed infants and the infected mothers ( 63) against heterologous HIV-1 variants and the quasispecies present in the mother. HIV-exposed uninfected infants (HEU) ( 42), compared to those that eventually acquired infection ( 21), did not possess higher nAb responses against heterologous envelopes ( = 0.46) or their mothers' variants ( = 0.45). Transmitting compared to nontransmitting mothers, however, had significantly higher plasma neutralizing activity against heterologous envelopes ( = 0.03), although these two groups did not have significant differences in their ability to neutralize autologous strains ( = 0.39). Furthermore, infants born to mothers with greater neutralizing breadth and potency were significantly more likely to have a serious adverse event ( = 0.03). These results imply that preexisting anti-HIV-1 neutralizing activity does not prevent breast milk transmission. Additionally, high maternal neutralizing breadth and potency may adversely influence both the frequency of breast milk transmission and subsequent infant morbidity. Passive immunization trials are under way to understand if preexisting antibodies can decrease mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission and improve infant outcomes. We examined the influence of preexisting maternal and infant neutralizing activity on transmission and infant morbidity in a breastfeeding mother-infant cohort. Neutralization was examined against both the exposure strains circulating in the infected mothers and a standardized reference panel previously used to estimate breadth. HIV-exposed uninfected infants did not possess a broader and more potent response against both the exposure and heterologous strains compared to infants that acquired infection. Transmitting, compared to nontransmitting, mothers had significantly higher neutralization breadth and potency but similar responses against autologous variants. Infants born to mothers with higher neutralization responses were more likely to have a serious adverse event. Our results suggest that preexisting antibodies do not protect against breast milk HIV-1 acquisition and may have negative consequences for the baby."

            "#text": "sequence type 131 (ST131), a pandemic clone responsible for the high incidence of extraintestinal pathogenic  (ExPEC) infections, has been known widely for its contribution to the worldwide dissemination of multidrug resistance. Although other ExPEC-associated and extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  clones, such as ST38, ST405, and ST648 have been studied widely, no comparative genomic data with respect to other genotypes exist for ST131. In this study, comparative genomic analysis was performed for 99 ST131  strains with 40 genomes from three other STs, including ST38 ( 12), ST405 ( 10), and ST648 ( 18), and functional studies were performed on five in-house strains corresponding to the four STs. Phylogenomic analysis results from this study corroborated with the sequence type-specific clonality. Results from the genome-wide resistance profiling confirmed that all strains were inherently multidrug resistant. ST131 genomes showed unique virulence profiles, and analysis of mobile genetic elements and their associated methyltransferases (MTases) has revealed that several of them were missing from the majority of the non-ST131 strains. Despite the fact that non-ST131 strains lacked few essential genes belonging to the serum resistome, the in-house strains representing all four STs demonstrated similar resistance levels to serum antibactericidal activity. Core genome analysis data revealed that non-ST131 strains usually lacked several ST131-defined genomic coordinates, and a significant number of genes were missing from the core of the ST131 genomes. Data from this study reinforce adaptive diversification of  strains belonging to the ST131 lineage and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying clonal diversification of the ST131 lineage., particularly the ST131 extraintestinal pathogenic  (ExPEC) lineage, is an important cause of community- and hospital-acquired infections, such as urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, bloodstream infections, and sepsis. The treatment of infections caused by ExPEC has become very challenging due to the emergence of resistance to the first-line as well as the last-resort antibiotics. This study analyzes  ST131 against three other important and globally distributed ExPEC lineages (ST38, ST405, and ST648) that also produced extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL). This is perhaps the first study that employs the high-throughput whole-genome sequence-based approach to compare and study the genomic features of these four ExPEC lineages in relation to their functional properties. Findings from this study highlight the differences in the genomic coordinates of ST131 with respect to the other STs considered here. Results from this comparative genomics study can help in advancing the understanding of ST131 evolution and also offer a framework towards future developments in pathogen identification and targeted therapeutics to prevent diseases caused by this pandemic  ST131 clone."

            "#text": "In the bacterium , the posttranscriptional regulatory system Csr was postulated to influence the transition from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis. Here, we explored the role of the Csr system in the glucose-acetate transition as a model of the glycolysis-to-gluconeogenesis switch. Mutations in the Csr system influence the reorganization of gene expression after glucose exhaustion and disturb the timing of acetate reconsumption after glucose exhaustion. Analysis of metabolite concentrations during the transition revealed that the Csr system has a major effect on the energy levels of the cells after glucose exhaustion. This influence was demonstrated to result directly from the effect of the Csr system on glycogen accumulation. Mutation in glycogen metabolism was also demonstrated to hinder metabolic adaptation after glucose exhaustion because of insufficient energy. This work explains how the Csr system influences  fitness during the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis switch and demonstrates the role of glycogen in maintenance of the energy charge during metabolic adaptation. Glycogen is a polysaccharide and the main storage form of glucose from bacteria such as  to yeasts and mammals. Although its function as a sugar reserve in mammals is well documented, the role of glycogen in bacteria is not as clear. By studying the role of posttranscriptional regulation during metabolic adaptation, for the first time, we demonstrate the role of sugar reserve played by glycogen in  Indeed, glycogen not only makes it possible to maintain sufficient energy during metabolic transitions but is also the key component in the capacity of cells to resume growth. Since the essential posttranscriptional regulatory system Csr is a major regulator of glycogen accumulation, this work also sheds light on the central role of posttranscriptional regulation in metabolic adaptation."

            "#text": "Flavor compound metabolism is one of the last areas in metabolism where multiple genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes are still unknown. A major challenge is the involvement of side activities of enzymes having their main function in other areas of metabolism. We have applied pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis to identify novel  genes affecting production of phenylethyl acetate (2-PEAc). This is a desirable flavor compound of major importance in alcoholic beverages imparting rose- and honey-like aromas, with production of high 2-PEAc levels considered a superior trait. Four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for high 2-PEAc production were identified, with two loci each showing linkage to the genomes of the BTC.1D and ER18 parents. The first two loci were investigated further. The causative genes were identified by reciprocal allele swapping into both parents using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9. The superior allele of the first major causative gene, , was dominant and contained two unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) responsible for high 2-PEAc production that were not present in other sequenced yeast strains.  encodes the alpha subunit of the fatty acid synthetase complex. Surprisingly, the second causative gene was a mutant allele of , a gene involved in nitrogen regulation. Exchange of both superior alleles in the ER18 parent strain increased 2-PEAc production 70%, nearly to the same level as in the best superior segregant. Our results show that polygenic analysis combined with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated allele exchange is a powerful tool for identification of genes encoding missing metabolic enzymes and for development of industrial yeast strains generating novel flavor profiles in alcoholic beverages. Multiple reactions in flavor metabolism appear to be catalyzed by side activities of other enzymes that have been difficult to identify. We have applied genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci in the yeast  to identify mutant alleles of genes determining the production of phenylethyl acetate, an important flavor compound imparting rose- and honey-like aromas to alcoholic beverages. We identified a unique, dominant allele of  that supports high production of phenylethyl acetate.  encodes a subunit of the fatty acid synthetase complex and apparently exerts an important side activity on one or more alternative substrates in flavor compound synthesis. The second mutant allele contained a nonsense mutation in , a gene involved in nitrogen regulation of growth. Together the two alleles strongly increased the level of phenylethyl acetate. Our work highlights the potential of genetic mapping of quantitative phenotypic traits to identify novel enzymes and regulatory components in yeast metabolism, including regular metabolic enzymes with unknown side activities responsible for biosynthesis of specific flavor compounds. The superior alleles identified can be used to develop industrial yeast strains generating novel flavor profiles in alcoholic beverages."

We investigated the mechanisms used for that purpose by  This uncultivable fungus is an obligate pulmonary pathogen that in immunocompromised individuals causes pneumonia, a major life-threatening infection. Long-read PacBio sequencing was used to assemble a core of subtelomeres of a single  strain from a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen from a single patient. A total of 113 genes encoding surface proteins were identified, including 28 pseudogenes. These genes formed a subtelomeric gene superfamily, which included five families encoding adhesive glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoproteins and one family encoding excreted glycoproteins. Numerical analyses suggested that diversification of the glycoproteins relies on mosaic genes created by ectopic recombination and occurs only within each family. DNA motifs suggested that all genes are expressed independently, except those of the family encoding the most abundant surface glycoproteins, which are subject to mutually exclusive expression. PCR analyses showed that exchange of the expressed gene of the latter family occurs frequently, possibly favored by the location of the genes proximal to the telomere because this allows concomitant telomere exchange. Our observations suggest that (i) the  cell surface is made of a complex mixture of different surface proteins, with a majority of a single isoform of the most abundant glycoprotein, (ii) genetic mosaicism within each family ensures variation of the glycoproteins, and (iii) the strategy of the fungus consists of the continuous production of new subpopulations composed of cells that are antigenically different. is a fungus causing severe pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals. It is the second most frequent life-threatening invasive fungal infection. We have studied the mechanisms of antigenic variation used by this pathogen to escape the human immune system, a strategy commonly used by pathogenic microorganisms. Using a new DNA sequencing technology generating long reads, we could characterize the highly repetitive gene families encoding the proteins that are present on the cellular surface of this pest. These gene families are localized in the regions close to the ends of all chromosomes, the subtelomeres. Such chromosomal localization was found to favor genetic recombinations between members of each gene family and to allow diversification of these proteins continuously over time. This pathogen seems to use a strategy of antigenic variation consisting of the continuous production of new subpopulations composed of cells that are antigenically different. Such a strategy is unique among human pathogens."

            "#text": "The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among the single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for ExoN functions during replication. Uniquely among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] either are nonviable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we showed that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt during long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogues that is explained only partially by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogues is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness."

The period of chromosome replication (C period) is a key stage in the bacterial cell cycle. However, the mechanism of  regulation of the C period remains unclear. In this study, we found that titration of the expression of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which changes the intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools, enables significant perturbations of the C period, leading to a substantial change in cell size and DNA content. Our work demonstrates that the intracellular dNTP pool is indeed an important parameter that controls the progression of chromosome replication. Specially, RNR overexpression leads to a shortened C period compared with that of a wild-type strain growing under different nutrient conditions, indicating that the dNTP substrate levels are subsaturated under physiological conditions. In addition, perturbing the C period does not significantly change the D period, indicating that these two processes are largely independent from each other. Overall, titration of ribonucleotide reductase expression can serve as a standard model system for studying the coordination between chromosome replication, cell division, and cell size. Bacteria must coordinate growth with cell cycle progression to maintain cell size hemostasis. Cell cycle and cell size regulation is a fundamental concern in biology. The period required for chromosome replication (the C period) is a key stage in the bacterial cell cycle. However, how the C period is controlled  remains largely an open question in this field of bacterial cell cycle regulation. Through introducing a genetic circuit into  for titrating the expression of ribonucleotide reductase, we achieve substantial perturbation of the C period and cell size. Our work demonstrates that the intracellular dNTP pool is an important parameter that controls the progression of chromosome replication. Moreover, our work indicates that bacterial cells manage to maintain subsaturated dNTP levels under different nutrient conditions, leading to a submaximal speed of DNA replication fork movement."

            "#text": "Many mutualistic microbial relationships are based on nutrient cross-feeding. Traditionally, cross-feeding is viewed as being unidirectional, from the producer to the recipient. This is likely true when a producer's waste, such as a fermentation product, has value only for a recipient. However, in some cases the cross-fed nutrient holds value for both the producer and the recipient. In such cases, there is potential for nutrient reacquisition by producer cells in a population, leading to competition against recipients. Here, we investigated the consequences of interpartner competition for cross-fed nutrients on mutualism dynamics by using an anaerobic coculture pairing fermentative  and phototrophic  In this coculture,  excretes waste organic acids that provide a carbon source for  In return,  cross-feeds  ammonium (NH), a compound that both species value. To explore the potential for interpartner competition, we first used a kinetic model to simulate cocultures with varied affinities for NH in each species. The model predicted that interpartner competition for NH could profoundly impact population dynamics. We then experimentally tested the predictions by culturing mutants lacking NH transporters in both NH competition assays and mutualistic cocultures. Both theoretical and experimental results indicated that the recipient must have a competitive advantage in acquiring cross-fed NH to sustain the mutualism. This recipient-biased competitive advantage is predicted to be crucial, particularly when the communally valuable nutrient is generated intracellularly. Thus, the very metabolites that form the basis for mutualistic cross-feeding can also be subject to competition between mutualistic partners. Mutualistic relationships, particularly those based on nutrient cross-feeding, promote stability of diverse ecosystems and drive global biogeochemical cycles. Cross-fed nutrients within these systems can be either waste products valued by only one partner or nutrients valued by both partners. Here, we explored how interpartner competition for a communally valuable cross-fed nutrient impacts mutualism dynamics. We discovered that mutualism stability necessitates that the recipient have a competitive advantage against the producer in obtaining the cross-fed nutrient, provided that the nutrient is generated intracellularly. We propose that the requirement for recipient-biased competition is a general rule for mutualistic coexistence based on the transfer of intracellularly generated, communally valuable resources."

However, the mechanism of such superior protection is not fully understood. Here we combined high-throughput fitness profiling of mutations in HIV-1 Gag,  prediction of MHC-peptide binding affinity, and analysis of intraperson virus evolution to systematically compare differences with respect to CTL escape mutations between epitopes targeted by protective MHC-I alleles and those targeted by nonprotective MHC-I alleles. We observed that the effects of mutations on both viral replication and MHC-I binding affinity are among the determinants of CTL escape. Mutations in Gag epitopes presented by protective MHC-I alleles are associated with significantly higher fitness cost and lower reductions in binding affinity with respect to MHC-I. A linear regression model accounting for the effect of mutations on both viral replicative capacity and MHC-I binding can explain the protective efficacy of MHC-I alleles. Finally, we found a consistent pattern in the evolution of Gag epitopes in long-term nonprogressors versus progressors. Overall, our results suggest that certain protective MHC-I alleles allow superior control of HIV-1 by targeting epitopes where mutations typically incur high fitness costs and small reductions in MHC-I binding affinity. Understanding the mechanism of viral control achieved in long-term nonprogressors with protective HLA alleles provides insights for developing functional cure of HIV infection. Through the characterization of CTL escape mutations in infected persons, previous researchers hypothesized that protective alleles target epitopes where escape mutations significantly reduce viral replicative capacity. However, these studies were usually limited to a few mutations observed  Here we utilized our recently developed high-throughput fitness profiling method to quantitatively measure the fitness of mutations across the entirety of HIV-1 Gag. The data enabled us to integrate the results with  prediction of MHC-peptide binding affinity and analysis of intraperson virus evolution to systematically determine the differences in CTL escape mutations between epitopes targeted by protective HLA alleles and those targeted by nonprotective HLA alleles. We observed that the effects of Gag epitope mutations on HIV replicative fitness and MHC-I binding affinity are among the major determinants of CTL escape."

            "#text": "Microbial growth arrest can be triggered by diverse factors, one of which is energy limitation due to scarcity of electron donors or acceptors. Genes that govern fitness during energy-limited growth arrest and the extent to which they overlap between different types of energy limitation are poorly defined. In this study, we exploited the fact that  can remain viable over several weeks when limited for organic carbon (pyruvate) as an electron donor or oxygen as an electron acceptor. ATP values were reduced under both types of limitation, yet more severely in the absence of oxygen. Using transposon-insertion sequencing (Tn-seq), we identified fitness determinants in these two energy-limited states. Multiple genes encoding general functions like transcriptional regulation and energy generation were required for fitness during carbon or oxygen limitation, yet many specific genes, and thus specific activities, differed in their relevance between these states. For instance, the global regulator RpoS was required during both types of energy limitation, while other global regulators such as DksA and LasR were required only during carbon or oxygen limitation, respectively. Similarly, certain ribosomal and tRNA modifications were specifically required during oxygen limitation. We validated fitness defects during energy limitation using independently generated mutants of genes detected in our screen. Mutants in distinct functional categories exhibited different fitness dynamics: regulatory genes generally manifested a phenotype early, whereas genes involved in cell wall metabolism were required later. Together, these results provide a new window into how  survives growth arrest. Growth-arrested bacteria are ubiquitous in nature and disease yet understudied at the molecular level. For example, growth-arrested cells constitute a major subpopulation of mature biofilms, serving as an antibiotic-tolerant reservoir in chronic infections. Identification of the genes required for survival of growth arrest (encompassing entry, maintenance, and exit) is an important first step toward understanding the physiology of bacteria in this state. Using Tn-seq, we identified and validated genes required for fitness of  when energy limited for organic carbon or oxygen, which represent two common causes of growth arrest for  in diverse habitats. This unbiased, genome-wide survey is the first to reveal essential activities for a pathogen experiencing different types of energy limitation, finding both shared and divergent activities that are relevant at different survival stages. Future efforts can now be directed toward understanding how the biomolecules responsible for these activities contribute to fitness under these conditions."

            "#text": "Microbial communities are shaped by interactions among their constituent members. Some Gram-negative bacteria employ type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) to inject protein toxins into neighboring cells. These interactions have been theorized to affect the composition of host-associated microbiomes, but the role of T6SSs in the evolution of gut communities is not well understood. We report the discovery of two T6SSs and numerous T6SS-associated Rhs toxins within the gut bacteria of honey bees and bumble bees. We sequenced the genomes of 28 strains of , a characteristic bee gut microbe, and found tremendous variability in their Rhs toxin complements: altogether, these strains appear to encode hundreds of unique toxins. Some toxins are shared with , a coresident gut symbiont, implicating horizontal gene transfer as a source of toxin diversity in the bee gut. We use data from a transposon mutagenesis screen to identify toxins with antibacterial function in the bee gut and validate the function and specificity of a subset of these toxin and immunity genes in  Using transcriptome sequencing, we demonstrate that  T6SSs and associated toxins are upregulated in the gut environment. We find that  Rhs loci have a conserved architecture, consistent with the C-terminal displacement model of toxin diversification, with Rhs toxins, toxin fragments, and cognate immunity genes that are expressed and confer strong fitness effects  Our findings of T6SS activity and Rhs toxin diversity suggest that T6SS-mediated competition may be an important driver of coevolution within the bee gut microbiota. The structure and composition of host-associated bacterial communities are of broad interest, because these communities affect host health. Bees have a simple, conserved gut microbiota, which provides an opportunity to explore interactions between species that have coevolved within their host over millions of years. This study examined the role of type VI secretion systems (T6SSs)-protein complexes used to deliver toxic proteins into bacterial competitors-within the bee gut microbiota. We identified two T6SSs and diverse T6SS-associated toxins in bacterial strains from bees. Expression of these genes is increased in bacteria in the bee gut, and toxin and immunity genes demonstrate antibacterial and protective functions, respectively, when expressed in  Our results suggest that coevolution among bacterial species in the bee gut has favored toxin diversification and maintenance of T6SS machinery, and demonstrate the importance of antagonistic interactions within host-associated microbial communities."

            "#text": "Bacterial persisters are phenotypic variants that survive antibiotic treatment in a dormant state and can be formed by multiple pathways. We recently proposed that the second messenger (p)ppGpp drives  persister formation through protease Lon and activation of toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules. This model found considerable support among researchers studying persisters but also generated controversy as part of recent debates in the field. In this study, we therefore used our previous work as a model to critically examine common experimental procedures to understand and overcome the inconsistencies often observed between results of different laboratories. Our results show that seemingly simple antibiotic killing assays are very sensitive to variations in culture conditions and bacterial growth phase. Additionally, we found that some assay conditions cause the killing of antibiotic-tolerant persisters via induction of cryptic prophages. Similarly, the inadvertent infection of mutant strains with bacteriophage ϕ80, a notorious laboratory contaminant, apparently caused several of the phenotypes that we reported in our previous studies. We therefore reconstructed all infected mutants and probed the validity of our model of persister formation in a refined assay setup that uses robust culture conditions and unravels the dynamics of persister cells through all bacterial growth stages. Our results confirm the importance of (p)ppGpp and Lon but no longer support a role of TA modules in  persister formation under unstressed conditions. We anticipate that the results and approaches reported in our study will lay the ground for future work in the field. The recalcitrance of antibiotic-tolerant persister cells is thought to cause relapsing infections and antibiotic treatment failure in various clinical setups. Previous studies identified multiple genetic pathways involved in persister formation but also revealed reproducibility problems that sparked controversies about adequate tools to study persister cells. In this study, we unraveled how typical antibiotic killing assays often fail to capture the biology of persisters and instead give widely differing results based on poorly controlled experimental parameters and artifacts caused by cryptic as well as contaminant prophages. We therefore established a new, robust assay that enabled us to follow the dynamics of persister cells through all growth stages of bacterial cultures without distortions by bacteriophages. This system also favored adequate comparisons of mutant strains with aberrant growth phenotypes. We anticipate that our results will contribute to a robust, common basis for future studies on the formation and eradication of antibiotic-tolerant persisters."

        "Abstract": "There is a growing realization that graduate education in the biomedical sciences is successful at teaching students how to conduct research but falls short in preparing them for a diverse job market, communicating with the public, and remaining versatile scientists throughout their careers. Major problems with graduate level education today include overspecialization in a narrow area of science without a proper grounding in essential critical thinking skills. Shortcomings in education may also contribute to some of the problems of the biomedical sciences, such as poor reproducibility, shoddy literature, and the rise in retracted publications. The challenge is to modify graduate programs such that they continue to generate individuals capable of conducting deep research while at the same time producing more broadly trained scientists without lengthening the time to a degree. Here we describe our first experiences at Johns Hopkins and propose a manifesto for reforming graduate science education.",

            "#text": "Although meiosis in warm-blooded organisms takes place in a narrow temperature range, meiosis in many organisms occurs over a wide variety of temperatures. We analyzed the properties of meiosis in the yeast  in cells sporulated at 14°C, 30°C, or 37°C. Using comparative-genomic-hybridization microarrays, we examined the distribution of Spo11-generated meiosis-specific double-stranded DNA breaks throughout the genome. Although there were between 300 and 400 regions of the genome with high levels of recombination (hot spots) observed at each temperature, only about 20% of these hot spots were found to have occurred independently of the temperature. In , regions near the telomeres and centromeres tend to have low levels of meiotic recombination. This tendency was observed in cells sporulated at 14°C and 30°C, but not at 37°C. Thus, the temperature of sporulation in yeast affects some global property of chromosome structure relevant to meiotic recombination. Using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-specific whole-genome microarrays, we also examined crossovers and their associated gene conversion events as well as gene conversion events that were unassociated with crossovers in all four spores of tetrads obtained by sporulation of diploids at 14°C, 30°C, or 37°C. Although tetrads from cells sporulated at 30°C had slightly (20%) more crossovers than those derived from cells sporulated at the other two temperatures, spore viability was good at all three temperatures. Thus, despite temperature-induced variation in the genetic maps, yeast cells produce viable haploid products at a wide variety of sporulation temperatures. In the yeast , recombination is usually studied in cells that undergo meiosis at 25°C or 30°C. In a genome-wide analysis, we showed that the locations of genomic regions with high and low levels of meiotic recombination (hot spots and cold spots, respectively) differed dramatically in cells sporulated at 14°C, 30°C, and 37°C. Thus, in yeast, and likely in other non-warm-blooded organisms, genetic maps are strongly affected by the environment."

The stringent response, toxin-antitoxin modules, and stochastic processes, among other mechanisms, play roles in this phenomenon. How persistence is regulated is relatively ill defined. Here we show that cyclic AMP, a global regulator of carbon catabolism and other core processes, is a negative regulator of bacterial persistence in uropathogenic , as measured by survival after exposure to a β-lactam antibiotic. This phenotype is regulated by a set of genes leading to an oxidative stress response and SOS-dependent DNA repair. Thus, persister cells tolerant to cell wall-acting antibiotics must cope with oxidative stress and DNA damage and these processes are regulated by cyclic AMP in uropathogenic  Bacterial persister cells are important in relapsing infections in patients treated with antibiotics and also in the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Our results show that in uropathogenic , the second messenger cyclic AMP negatively regulates persister cell formation, since in its absence much more persister cells form that are tolerant to β-lactams antibiotics. We reveal the mechanism to be decreased levels of reactive oxygen species, specifically hydroxyl radicals, and SOS-dependent DNA repair. Our findings suggest that the oxidative stress response and DNA repair are relevant pathways to target in the design of persister-specific antibiotic compounds."

            "#text": "Transmission of flaviviruses by hematophagous insects such as mosquitoes requires acquisition of the virus during blood feeding on the host, with midgut as the primary infection site. Here, we report that N-glycosylation of the E protein, which is conserved among most flaviviruses, is critical for the Zika virus (ZIKV) to invade the vector midgut by inhibiting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway of the mosquito immune system. Our data further show that removal of the ZIKV E glycosylation site prevents mosquito infection by flaviviruses via the oral route, whereas there is no effect on infection by intrathoracic microinjection, which bypasses the midgut. Interestingly, the defect in infection of the mosquito midgut by the mutant virus through blood feeding is rescued by reduction of the ROS level by application of vitamin C, a well-known antioxidant. Therefore, our data demonstrate that ZIKV utilizes the glycosylation on the envelope to antagonize the vector immune defense during infection. Most flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), are transmitted between hosts by arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, which acquire the virus during a blood meal. Here, by mutagenesis, we found a major role of the N-glycosylation of flavivirus E protein in its transmission circle, facilitating its survival against the vector immune system during invasion of the mosquito midgut while blood feeding on the host. In spite of the extensive studies of the involvement of N-glycan modification of flavivirus E protein in virus-host interactions, we discovered its critical role in virus-vector interaction and the evolution of flavivirus. Given the deleterious effects of ZIKV on human health, this study might have a significant impact on development of novel transmission-blocking strategies."

            "#text": "Oat crown rust, caused by the fungus  f. sp. , is a devastating disease that impacts worldwide oat production. For much of its life cycle,  f. sp.  is dikaryotic, with two separate haploid nuclei that may vary in virulence genotype, highlighting the importance of understanding haplotype diversity in this species. We generated highly contiguous  genome assemblies of two  f. sp.  isolates, 12SD80 and 12NC29, from long-read sequences. In total, we assembled 603 primary contigs for 12SD80, for a total assembly length of 99.16 Mbp, and 777 primary contigs for 12NC29, for a total length of 105.25 Mbp; approximately 52% of each genome was assembled into alternate haplotypes. This revealed structural variation between haplotypes in each isolate equivalent to more than 2% of the genome size, in addition to about 260,000 and 380,000 heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 12SD80 and 12NC29, respectively. Transcript-based annotation identified 26,796 and 28,801 coding sequences for isolates 12SD80 and 12NC29, respectively, including about 7,000 allele pairs in haplotype-phased regions. Furthermore, expression profiling revealed clusters of coexpressed secreted effector candidates, and the majority of orthologous effectors between isolates showed conservation of expression patterns. However, a small subset of orthologs showed divergence in expression, which may contribute to differences in virulence between 12SD80 and 12NC29. This study provides the first haplotype-phased reference genome for a dikaryotic rust fungus as a foundation for future studies into virulence mechanisms in  f. sp.  Disease management strategies for oat crown rust are challenged by the rapid evolution of  f. sp. , which renders resistance genes in oat varieties ineffective. Despite the economic importance of understanding  f. sp. , resources to study the molecular mechanisms underpinning pathogenicity and the emergence of new virulence traits are lacking. Such limitations are partly due to the obligate biotrophic lifestyle of  f. sp.  as well as the dikaryotic nature of the genome, features that are also shared with other important rust pathogens. This study reports the first release of a haplotype-phased genome assembly for a dikaryotic fungal species and demonstrates the amenability of using emerging technologies to investigate genetic diversity in populations of  f. sp. ."

            "#text": "is a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that causes superficial and invasive infections in the hospital and community. High mortality from infection emphasizes the need for improved methods for prevention and treatment. Although  possesses an arsenal of virulence factors that contribute to evasion of host defenses, few studies have examined long-term humoral and B-cell responses. Adults with acute-phase skin and soft tissue infections were recruited; blood samples were obtained; and  isolates, including methicillin-resistant strains, were subjected to genomic sequence analysis. In comparisons of acute-phase sera with convalescent-phase sera, a minority (37.5%) of patients displayed 2-fold or greater increases in antibody titers against three or more  antigens, whereas nearly half exhibited no changes, despite the presence of toxin genes in most infecting strains. Moreover, enhanced antibody responses waned over time, which could reflect a defect in B-cell memory or long-lived plasma cells. However, memory B cells reactive with a range of  antigens were prevalent at both acute-phase and convalescent-phase time points. While some memory B cells exhibited toxin-specific binding, those cross-reactive with structurally related leucocidin subunits were dominant across patients, suggesting the targeting of conserved epitopes. Memory B-cell reactivity correlated with serum antibody levels for selected  exotoxins, suggesting a relationship between the cellular and humoral compartments. Overall, although there was no global defect in the representation of anti- memory B cells, there was evidence of restrictions in the range of epitopes recognized, which may suggest potential therapeutic approaches for augmenting host defenses. The contribution of B-cell memory and long-term antibody responses to host defenses against  exotoxins remains poorly understood. Our studies confirmed that infection did not commonly lead to enhanced long-term humoral responses. Whereas circulating memory B cells against  secreted exotoxins were prevalent, they were dominated by cross-reactivity with structurally related leucocidin subunits, consistent with recognition of conserved epitopes. These findings also provide the first evidence of a relationship between the reactivity of antistaphylococcal circulating memory B cells and serum antibody levels. In general, infection was not associated with a global defect in B-cell memory for  secreted factors, and responses were highly dominated by cross-reactivity to structurally related exotoxins, which arguably may alone be suboptimal in providing host defenses. Our studies illuminate aspects of the host relationship that may better inform strategies for the development of an effective protective vaccine."

            "#text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) spreads via secreted cell-free particles or direct cell-to-cell transmission. Yet, virus-host determinants governing differential intracellular trafficking of cell-free- and cell-to-cell-transmitted virus remain unknown. The host adaptor proteins (APs) AP-1A, AP-1B, and AP-4 traffic in post-Golgi compartments, and the latter two are implicated in basolateral sorting. We reported that AP-1A mediates HCV trafficking during release, whereas the endocytic adaptor AP-2 mediates entry and assembly. We demonstrated that the host kinases AAK1 and GAK regulate HCV infection by controlling these clathrin-associated APs. Here, we sought to define the roles of AP-4, a clathrin-independent adaptor; AP-1A; and AP-1B in HCV infection. We screened for interactions between HCV proteins and the μ subunits of AP-1A, AP-1B, and AP-4 by mammalian cell-based protein fragment complementation assays. The nonstructural 2 (NS2) protein emerged as an interactor of these adaptors in this screening and by coimmunoprecipitations in HCV-infected cells. Two previously unrecognized dileucine-based motifs in the NS2 C terminus mediated AP binding and HCV release. Infectivity and coculture assays demonstrated that while all three adaptors mediate HCV release and cell-free spread, AP-1B and AP-4, but not AP-1A, mediate cell-to-cell spread. Live-cell imaging revealed HCV cotrafficking with AP-1A, AP-1B, and AP-4 and that AP-4 mediates HCV trafficking in a post-Golgi compartment. Lastly, HCV cell-to-cell spread was regulated by AAK1 and GAK and thus susceptible to treatment with AAK1 and GAK inhibitors. These data provide a mechanistic understanding of HCV trafficking in distinct release pathways and reveal a requirement for APs in cell-to-cell viral spread. HCV spreads via cell-free infection or cell-to-cell contact that shields it from antibody neutralization, thereby facilitating viral persistence. Yet, factors governing this differential sorting remain unknown. By integrating proteomic, RNA interference, genetic, live-cell imaging, and pharmacological approaches, we uncover differential coopting of host adaptor proteins (APs) to mediate HCV traffic at distinct late steps of the viral life cycle. We reported that AP-1A and AP-2 mediate HCV trafficking during release and assembly, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that dileucine motifs in the NS2 protein mediate AP-1A, AP-1B, and AP-4 binding and cell-free virus release. Moreover, we reveal that AP-4, an adaptor not previously implicated in viral infections, mediates cell-to-cell spread and HCV trafficking. Lastly, we demonstrate cell-to-cell spread regulation by AAK1 and GAK, host kinases controlling APs, and susceptibility to their inhibitors. This study provides mechanistic insights into virus-host determinants that facilitate HCV trafficking, with potential implications for pathogenesis and antiviral agent design."

            "#text": "Long-term survivors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been shown to have a greatly increased incidence of B cell lymphomas. This increased lymphomagenesis suggests some link between HIV infection and the destabilization of the host B cell genome, a phenomenon also suggested by the extraordinary high frequency of mutation, insertion, and deletion in the broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies. Since HIV does not infect B cells, the molecular mechanisms of this genomic instability remain to be fully defined. Here, we demonstrate that the cell membrane-permeable HIV Tat proteins enhance activation-induced deaminase (AID)-mediated somatic hypermutation (SHM) of antibody V regions through their modulation of the endogenous polymerase II (Pol II) transcriptional process. Extremely small amounts of Tat that could come from bystander HIV-infected cells were sufficient to promote SHM. Our data suggest HIV Tat is one missing link between HIV infection and the overall B cell genomic instability in AIDS patients. Although the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has successfully controlled primary effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, such as HIV proliferation and HIV-induced immune deficiency, it did not eliminate the increased susceptibility of HIV-infected patients to B cell lymphomas. We find that a secreted HIV protein, Tat, enhances the intrinsic antibody diversification mechanism by increasing the AID-induced somatic mutations at the heavy-chain variable (VH) regions in human B cells. This could contribute to the high rate of mutation in the variable regions of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies and the genomewide mutations leading to B cell malignancies in HIV carriers."

            "#text": "The clinical severity and annual occurrence of influenza virus epidemics, combined with the availability of just a single class of antivirals to treat infections, underscores the urgent need to develop new anti-influenza drugs. The endonuclease activity within the viral acidic polymerase (PA) protein is an attractive target for drug discovery due to the critical role it plays in viral gene transcription. RO-7 is a next-generation PA endonuclease inhibitor of influenza A and B viruses, but its drug resistance potential is unknown. Through serial passage of influenza A(H1N1) viruses in MDCK cells under selective pressure of RO-7, we identified an I38T substitution within the PA endonuclease domain that conferred  resistance to RO-7 (up to a 287-fold change in 50% effective concentration [EC]). I38T emerged between 5 and 10 passages, and when introduced into recombinant influenza A(H1N1) viruses, alone conferred RO-7 resistance (up to an 81-fold change in EC). Cocrystal structures of mutant and wild-type endonuclease domains with RO-7 provided the structural basis of resistance, where a key hydrophobic interaction between RO-7 and the Ile38 side chain is compromised when mutated to the polar threonine. While Ile38 does not have a crucial role in coordinating the endonuclease active site, the switch to threonine does affect the polymerase activity of some viruses and influences RO-7 affinity for the PA target (i.e., the ≈200-residue N-terminal domain of PA). However, the change does not lead to a complete loss of replication activity  Our results predict that RO-7-resistant influenza viruses carrying the I38T substitution may emerge under treatment. This should be taken into consideration for clinical surveillance and in refinement of these drugs. The effectiveness of antiviral drugs can be severely compromised by the emergence of resistant viruses. Therefore, determination of the mechanisms by which viruses become resistant is critical for drug development and clinical use. RO-7 is a compound that potently inhibits influenza virus replication and belongs to a new class of drugs in late-stage clinical trials for treatment of influenza virus infection. Here we demonstrate that a single amino acid change acquired under prolonged virus exposure to RO-7 renders influenza viruses significantly less susceptible to its inhibitory effects. We have discovered how the mutation can simultaneously interfere with drug activity and still maintain efficient virus replication. These findings have important implications for the development of more effective derivatives of RO-7-like drugs and provide guidance for how to monitor the emergence of resistance."

This leads to chronic inflammation, which also contributes to development of cancer. Association with  increases the risk of gastric carcinoma, and coexistence with EBV enhances proliferation of infected cells. Further, -EBV coinfection causes chronic inflammation in pediatric patients. We have established an -EBV coinfection model system using human gastric epithelial cells. We showed that  infection can increase the oncogenic phenotype of EBV-infected cells and that the cytotoxin-associated gene (CagA) protein encoded by  stimulated EBV-mediated cell proliferation in this coinfection model system. This led to increased expression of DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs), which reprogrammed cellular transcriptional profiles, including those of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), through hypermethylation. These findings provide new insights into a molecular mechanism whereby cooperativity between two oncogenic agents leads to enhanced oncogenic activity of gastric cancer cells. We have studied the cooperativity between  and EBV, two known oncogenic agents. This led to an enhanced oncogenic phenotype in gastric epithelial cells. We now demonstrate that EBV-driven epigenetic modifications are enhanced in the presence of , more specifically, in the presence of its CagA secretory antigen. This results in increased proliferation of the infected gastric cells. Our findings now elucidate a molecular mechanism whereby expression of cellular DNA methyl transferases is induced influencing infection by EBV. Hypermethylation of the regulatory genomic regions of tumor suppressor genes results in their silencing. This drastically affects the expression of cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair genes, which dysregulates their associated processes, and promotion of the oncogenic phenotype."

            "#text": "Recent reports have established the escalating threat of carbapenem-resistant  complex (CREC). Here, we demonstrate that CREC has evolved as a highly antibiotic-resistant rather than highly virulent nosocomial pathogen. Applying genomics and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to a 7-year collection of CREC isolates from a northern Manhattan hospital system and to a large set of publicly available, geographically diverse genomes, we demonstrate clonal spread of a single clone, ST171. We estimate that two major clades of epidemic ST171 diverged prior to 1962, subsequently spreading in parallel from the Northeastern to the Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern United States and demonstrating links to international sites. Acquisition of carbapenem and fluoroquinolone resistance determinants by both clades preceded widespread use of these drugs in the mid-1980s, suggesting that antibiotic pressure contributed substantially to its spread. Despite a unique mobile repertoire, ST171 isolates showed decreased virulence  While a second clone, ST78, substantially contributed to the emergence of CREC, it encompasses diverse carbapenemase-harboring plasmids, including a potentially hypertransmissible IncN plasmid, also present in other sequence types. Rather than heightened virulence, CREC demonstrates lineage-specific, multifactorial adaptations to nosocomial environments coupled with a unique potential to acquire and disseminate carbapenem resistance genes. These findings indicate a need for robust surveillance efforts that are attentive to the potential for local and international spread of high-risk CREC clones. Carbapenem-resistant  complex (CREC) has emerged as a formidable nosocomial pathogen. While sporadic acquisition of plasmid-encoded carbapenemases has been implicated as a major driver of CREC, ST171 and ST78 clones demonstrate epidemic potential. However, a lack of reliable genomic references and rigorous statistical analyses has left many gaps in knowledge regarding the phylogenetic context and evolutionary pathways of successful CREC. Our reconstruction of recent ST171 and ST78 evolution represents a significant addition to current understanding of CREC and the directionality of its spread from the Eastern United States to the northern Midwestern United States with links to international collections. Our results indicate that the remarkable ability of  to acquire and disseminate cross-class antibiotic resistance rather than virulence determinants, coupled with its ability to adapt under conditions of antibiotic pressure, likely led to the wide dissemination of CREC."

            "#text": "Group 2 capsule polymers represent crucial virulence factors of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. They are synthesized by enzymes called capsule polymerases. In this report, we describe a new family of polymerases that combine glycosyltransferase and hexose- and polyol-phosphate transferase activity to generate complex poly(oligosaccharide phosphate) and poly(glycosylpolyol phosphate) polymers, the latter of which display similarity to wall teichoic acid (WTA), a cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria. Using modeling and multiple-sequence alignment, we showed homology between the predicted polymerase domains and WTA type I biosynthesis enzymes, creating a link between Gram-negative and Gram-positive cell wall biosynthesis processes. The polymerases of the new family are highly abundant and found in a variety of capsule-expressing pathogens such as , , , , and  with both human and animal hosts. Five representative candidates were purified, their activities were confirmed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and their predicted folds were validated by site-directed mutagenesis. Bacterial capsules play an important role in the interaction between a pathogen and the immune system of its host. During the last decade, capsule polymerases have become attractive tools for the production of capsule polymers applied as antigens in glycoconjugate vaccine formulations. Conventional production of glycoconjugate vaccines requires the cultivation of the pathogen and thus the highest biosafety standards, leading to tremendous costs. With regard to animal husbandry, where vaccines could avoid the extensive use of antibiotics, conventional production is not sufficiently cost-effective. In contrast, enzymatic synthesis of capsule polymers is pathogen-free and fast, offers high stereo- and regioselectivity, and works with high efficacy. The new capsule polymerase family described here vastly increases the toolbox of enzymes available for biotechnology purposes. Representatives are abundantly found in human pathogens but also in animal pathogens, paving the way for the exploitation of polymerases for the development of a new generation of vaccines for animal husbandry."

            "#text": "is the major etiologic agent of antibiotic-associated intestinal disease. Pathogenesis of  is mainly attributed to the production and secretion of toxins A and B. Unlike most clostridial toxins, toxins A and B have no signal peptide, and they are therefore secreted by unusual mechanisms involving the holin-like TcdE protein and/or autolysis. In this study, we characterized the cell surface protein Cwp19, a newly identified peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme containing a novel catalytic domain. We purified a recombinant His-tagged Cwp19 protein and showed that it has lytic transglycosylase activity. Moreover, we observed that Cwp19 is involved in cell autolysis and that a  mutant exhibited delayed autolysis in stationary phase compared to the wild type when bacteria were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium. Wild-type cell autolysis is correlated to strong alterations of cell wall thickness and integrity and to release of cytoplasmic material. Furthermore, we demonstrated that toxins were released into the extracellular medium as a result of Cwp19-induced autolysis when cells were grown in BHI medium. In contrast, Cwp19 did not induce autolysis or toxin release when cells were grown in tryptone-yeast extract (TY) medium. These data provide evidence for the first time that TcdE and bacteriolysis are coexisting mechanisms for toxin release, with their relative contributions  depending on growth conditions. Thus, Cwp19 is an important surface protein involved in autolysis of vegetative cells of  that mediates the release of the toxins from the cell cytosol in response to specific environment conditions.-associated disease is mainly known as a health care-associated infection. It represents the most problematic hospital-acquired infection in North America and Europe and exerts significant economic pressure on health care systems. Virulent strains of  generally produce two toxins that have been identified as the major virulence factors. The mechanism for release of these toxins from bacterial cells is not yet fully understood but is thought to be partly mediated by bacteriolysis. Here we identify a novel peptidoglycan hydrolase in , Cwp19, exhibiting lytic transglycosylase activity. We show that Cwp19 contributes to  cell autolysis in the stationary phase and, consequently, to toxin release, most probably as a response to environmental conditions such as nutritional signals. These data highlight that Cwp19 constitutes a promising target for the development of new preventive and curative strategies."

            "#text": "Human parainfluenza viruses cause a large burden of human respiratory illness. While much research relies upon viruses grown in cultured immortalized cells, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3) evolves in culture. Cultured viruses differ in their properties compared to clinical strains. We present a genome-wide survey of HPIV-3 adaptations to culture using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of matched pairs of clinical samples and primary culture isolates (zero passage virus). Nonsynonymous changes arose during primary viral isolation, almost entirely in the genes encoding the two surface glycoproteins-the receptor binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or the fusion protein (F). We recovered genomes from 95 HPIV-3 primary culture isolates and 23 HPIV-3 strains directly from clinical samples. HN mutations arising during primary viral isolation resulted in substitutions at HN's dimerization/F-interaction site, a site critical for activation of viral fusion. Alterations in HN dimer interface residues known to favor infection in culture occurred within 4 days (H552 and N556). A novel cluster of residues at a different face of the HN dimer interface emerged (P241 and R242) and imply a role in HPIV-3-mediated fusion. Functional characterization of these culture-associated HN mutations in a clinical isolate background revealed acquisition of the fusogenic phenotype associated with cultured HPIV-3; the HN-F complex showed enhanced fusion and decreased receptor-cleaving activity. These results utilize a method for identifying genome-wide changes associated with brief adaptation to culture to highlight the notion that even brief exposure to immortalized cells may affect key viral properties and underscore the balance of features of the HN-F complex required for fitness by circulating viruses. Human parainfluenza virus 3 is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. Using deep genomic sequencing of HPIV-3-positive clinical material and its subsequent viral isolate, we discover a number of known and novel coding mutations in the main HPIV-3 attachment protein HN during brief exposure to immortalized cells. These mutations significantly alter function of the fusion complex, increasing fusion promotion by HN as well as generally decreasing neuraminidase activity and increasing HN-receptor engagement. These results show that viruses may evolve rapidly in culture even during primary isolation of the virus and before the first passage and reveal features of fitness for humans that are obscured by rapid adaptation to laboratory conditions."

            "#text": "Influenza A viruses cause an annual contagious respiratory disease in humans and are responsible for periodic high-mortality human pandemics. Pandemic influenza A viruses usually result from the reassortment of gene segments between human and avian influenza viruses. These avian influenza virus gene segments need to adapt to humans. Here we focus on the human adaptation of the synonymous codons of the avian influenza virus PB1 gene of the 1968 H3N2 pandemic virus. We generated recombinant H3N2 viruses differing only in codon usage of PB1 mRNA and demonstrated that codon usage of the PB1 mRNA of recent H3N2 virus isolates enhances replication in interferon (IFN)-treated human cells without affecting replication in untreated cells, thereby partially alleviating the interferon-induced antiviral state. High-throughput sequencing of tRNA pools explains the reduced inhibition of replication by interferon: the levels of some tRNAs differ between interferon-treated and untreated human cells, and evolution of the codon usage of H3N2 PB1 mRNA is skewed toward interferon-altered human tRNA pools. Consequently, the avian influenza virus-derived PB1 mRNAs of modern H3N2 viruses have acquired codon usages that better reflect tRNA availabilities in IFN-treated cells. Our results indicate that the change in tRNA availabilities resulting from interferon treatment is a previously unknown aspect of the antiviral action of interferon, which has been partially overcome by human-adapted H3N2 viruses. Pandemic influenza A viruses that cause high human mortality usually result from reassortment of gene segments between human and avian influenza viruses. These avian influenza virus gene segments need to adapt to humans. Here we focus on the human adaptation of the avian influenza virus PB1 gene that was incorporated into the 1968 H3N2 pandemic virus. We demonstrate that the coding sequence of the PB1 mRNA of modern H3N2 viruses enhances replication in human cells in which interferon has activated a potent antiviral state. Reduced interferon inhibition results from evolution of PB1 mRNA codons skewed toward the pools of tRNAs in interferon-treated human cells, which, as shown here, differ significantly from the tRNA pools in untreated human cells. Consequently, avian influenza virus-derived PB1 mRNAs of modern H3N2 viruses have acquired codon usages that better reflect tRNA availabilities in IFN-treated cells and are translated more efficiently."

            "#text": "The cellular mRNA decay protein AUF1 acts as a restriction factor during infection by picornaviruses, including poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and human rhinovirus. AUF1 relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during infection by these viruses due to the disruption of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking by viral proteinases. Previous studies have demonstrated that AUF1 binds to poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) RNA during infection, with binding shown to occur within the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the 5' noncoding region (NCR) or the 3' NCR, respectively. Binding to different sites within the viral RNA suggests that AUF1 may negatively regulate infection by these viruses using different mechanisms. The work presented here addresses the mechanism of AUF1 inhibition of the replication of poliovirus and CVB3. We demonstrate that AUF1 knockdown in human cells results in increased viral translation, RNA synthesis, and virus production. AUF1 is shown to negatively regulate translation of a poliovirus and CVB3 IRES reporter RNA during infection but not in uninfected cells. We found that this inhibitory activity is not mediated through destabilization of viral genomic RNA; however, it does require virus-induced relocalization of AUF1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during the early phases of infection. Our findings suggest that AUF1 restriction of poliovirus and CVB3 replication uses a common mechanism through the viral IRES, which is distinct from the canonical role that AUF1 plays in regulated mRNA decay in uninfected host cells. Picornaviruses primarily infect the gastrointestinal or upper respiratory tracts of humans and animals and may disseminate to tissues of the central nervous system, heart, skin, liver, or pancreas. Many common human pathogens belong to the  family, which includes viruses known to cause paralytic poliomyelitis (poliovirus); myocarditis (coxsackievirus B3 [CVB3]); the common cold (human rhinovirus [HRV]); and hand, foot, and mouth disease (enterovirus 71 [EV71]), among other illnesses. There are no specific treatments for infection, and vaccines exist for only two picornaviruses: poliovirus and hepatitis A virus. Given the worldwide distribution and prevalence of picornaviruses, it is important to gain insight into the host mechanisms used to restrict infection. Other than proteins involved in the innate immune response, few host factors have been identified that restrict picornavirus replication. The work presented here seeks to define the mechanism of action for the host restriction factor AUF1 during infection by poliovirus and CVB3."

            "#text": "Iron is an indispensable micronutrient for all eukaryotic organisms due to its participation as a redox cofactor in many metabolic pathways. Iron imbalance leads to the most frequent human nutritional deficiency in the world. Adaptation to iron limitation requires a global reorganization of the cellular metabolism directed to prioritize iron utilization for essential processes. In response to iron scarcity, the conserved  mRNA-binding protein Cth2, which belongs to the tristetraprolin family of tandem zinc finger proteins, coordinates a global remodeling of the cellular metabolism by promoting the degradation of multiple mRNAs encoding highly iron-consuming proteins. In this work, we identify a critical mechanism for the degradation of Cth2 protein during the adaptation to iron deficiency. Phosphorylation of a patch of Cth2 serine residues within its amino-terminal region facilitates recognition by the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, accelerating Cth2 turnover by the proteasome. When Cth2 degradation is impaired by either mutagenesis of the Cth2 serine residues or deletion of , the levels of Cth2 rise and abrogate growth in iron-depleted conditions. Finally, we uncover that the casein kinase Hrr25 phosphorylates and promotes Cth2 destabilization. These results reveal a sophisticated posttranslational regulatory pathway necessary for the adaptation to iron depletion. Iron is a vital element for many metabolic pathways, including the synthesis of DNA and proteins, and the generation of energy via oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, living organisms have developed tightly controlled mechanisms to properly distribute iron, since imbalances lead to nutritional deficiencies, multiple diseases, and vulnerability against pathogens.  Cth2 is a conserved mRNA-binding protein that coordinates a global reprogramming of iron metabolism in response to iron deficiency in order to optimize its utilization. Here we report that the phosphorylation of Cth2 at specific serine residues is essential to regulate the stability of the protein and adaptation to iron depletion. We identify the kinase and ubiquitination machinery implicated in this process to establish a posttranscriptional regulatory model. These results and recent findings for both mammals and plants reinforce the privileged position of E3 ubiquitin ligases and phosphorylation events in the regulation of eukaryotic iron homeostasis."

            "#text": "Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses package several RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) together with their dsRNA genome into an icosahedral protein capsid known as the polymerase complex. This structure is highly conserved among dsRNA viruses but is not found in any other virus group. RdRp subunits typically interact directly with the main capsid proteins, close to the 5-fold symmetric axes, and perform viral genome replication and transcription within the icosahedral protein shell. In this study, we utilized  phage Φ6, a well-established virus self-assembly model, to probe the potential roles of the RdRp in dsRNA virus assembly. We demonstrated that Φ6 RdRp accelerates the polymerase complex self-assembly process and contributes to its conformational stability and integrity. We highlight the role of specific amino acid residues on the surface of the RdRp in its incorporation during the self-assembly reaction. Substitutions of these residues reduce RdRp incorporation into the polymerase complex during the self-assembly reaction. Furthermore, we determined that the overall transcription efficiency of the Φ6 polymerase complex increased when the number of RdRp subunits exceeded the number of genome segments. These results suggest a mechanism for RdRp recruitment in the polymerase complex and highlight its novel role in virion assembly, in addition to the canonical RNA transcription and replication functions. Double-stranded RNA viruses infect a wide spectrum of hosts, including animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. Yet genome replication mechanisms of these viruses are conserved. During the infection cycle, a proteinaceous capsid, the polymerase complex, is formed. An essential component of this capsid is the viral RNA polymerase that replicates and transcribes the enclosed viral genome. The polymerase complex structure is well characterized for many double-stranded RNA viruses. However, much less is known about the hierarchical molecular interactions that take place in building up such complexes. Using the bacteriophage Φ6 self-assembly system, we obtained novel insights into the processes that mediate polymerase subunit incorporation into the polymerase complex for generation of functional structures. The results presented pave the way for the exploitation and engineering of viral self-assembly processes for biomedical and synthetic biology applications. An understanding of viral assembly processes at the molecular level may also facilitate the development of antivirals that target viral capsid assembly."

Specifically, infected adult bees typically abandon the hive or are removed by guards. , an opportunistic pathogen of many plants and animals, is often present at low abundance in the guts of honey bee workers and has recently been isolated from Varroa mites and from the hemolymph of dead and dying honey bees. However, the severity and prevalence of  pathogenicity in honey bees have not been fully investigated. Here we characterized three  strains isolated from the guts of honey bees and one previously isolated from hemolymph.  tests confirmed that  is pathogenic in workers. All strains caused mortality when a few cells were injected into the hemocoel, and the gut-isolated strains caused mortality when administered orally.  assays and comparative genomics identified possible mechanisms of virulence of gut-associated strains. Expression of antimicrobial peptide and phenoloxidase genes was not elevated following infection, suggesting that these  strains derived from honey bees can evade the immune response in their hosts. Finally, surveys from four locations in the United States indicated the presence of  in the guts of over 60% of the worker bees evaluated. Taken together, these results suggest that  is a widespread opportunistic pathogen of adult honey bees and that it may be highly virulent under some conditions such as perturbation of the normal gut microbiota or the presence of Varroa mites that puncture the integument, thereby enabling entry of bacterial cells. Recently, it has become apparent that multiple factors are responsible for honey bee decline, including climate change, pests and pathogens, pesticides, and loss of foraging habitat. Of the large number of pathogens known to infect honey bees, very few are bacteria. Because adult workers abandon hives when diseased, many of their pathogens may go unnoticed. Here we characterized the virulence of  strains isolated from honey bee guts and hemolymph. Our results indicate that , an opportunistic pathogen of many plants and animals, including humans, is a virulent opportunistic pathogen of honey bees, which could contribute to bee decline. Aside from the implications for honey bee health, the discovery of pathogenic  strains in honey bees presents an opportunity to better understand how opportunistic pathogens infect and invade hosts."

            "#text": "Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has historically been associated with respiratory illnesses. However, in the summers of 2014 and 2016, EV-D68 outbreaks coincided with a spike in polio-like acute flaccid myelitis/paralysis (AFM/AFP) cases. This raised concerns that EV-D68 could be the causative agent of AFM during these recent outbreaks. To assess the potential neurotropism of EV-D68, we utilized the neuroblastoma-derived neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y as a cell culture model to determine if differential infection is observed for different EV-D68 strains. In contrast to HeLa and A549 cells, which support viral infection of all EV-D68 strains tested, SH-SY5Y cells only supported infection by a subset of contemporary EV-D68 strains, including isolates from the 2014 outbreak. Viral replication and infectivity in SH-SY5Y were assessed using multiple assays: virus production, cytopathic effects, cellular ATP release, and VP1 capsid protein production. Similar differential neurotropism was also observed in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, primary human neuron cultures, and a mouse paralysis model. Using the SH-SY5Y cell culture model, we determined that barriers to viral binding and entry were at least partly responsible for the differential infectivity phenotype. Transfection of genomic RNA into SH-SY5Y generated virions for all EV-D68 isolates, but only a single round of replication was observed from strains that could not directly infect SH-SY5Y. In addition to supporting virus replication and other functional studies, this cell culture model may help identify the signatures of virulence to confirm epidemiological associations between EV-D68 strains and AFM and allow for the rapid identification and characterization of emerging neurotropic strains. Since the EV-D68 outbreak during the summer of 2014, evidence of a causal link to a type of limb paralysis (AFM) has been mounting. In this article, we describe a neuronal cell culture model (SH-SY5Y cells) in which a subset of contemporary 2014 outbreak strains of EV-D68 show infectivity in neuronal cells, or neurotropism. We confirmed the difference in neurotropism  using primary human neuron cell cultures and  with a mouse paralysis model. Using the SH-SY5Y cell model, we determined that a barrier to viral entry is at least partly responsible for neurotropism. SH-SY5Y cells may be useful in determining if specific EV-D68 genetic determinants are associated with neuropathogenesis, and replication in this cell line could be used as rapid screening tool for identification of neurotropic EV-D68 strains. This may assist with better understanding of pathogenesis and epidemiology and with the development of potential therapies."

            "#text": "Late in the HIV-1 replication cycle, the viral structural protein Gag is targeted to virus assembly sites at the plasma membrane of infected cells. The capsid (CA) domain of Gag plays a critical role in the formation of the hexameric Gag lattice in the immature virion, and, during particle release, CA is cleaved from the Gag precursor by the viral protease and forms the conical core of the mature virion. A highly conserved Pro-Pro-Ile-Pro (PPIP) motif (CA residues 122 to 125) [PPIP(122-125)] in a loop connecting CA helices 6 and 7 resides at a 3-fold axis formed by neighboring hexamers in the immature Gag lattice. In this study, we characterized the role of this PPIP(122-125) loop in HIV-1 assembly and maturation. While mutations P123A and P125A were relatively well tolerated, mutation of P122 and I124 significantly impaired virus release, caused Gag processing defects, and abolished infectivity. X-ray crystallography indicated that the P122A and I124A mutations induce subtle changes in the structure of the mature CA lattice which were permissive for  assembly of CA tubes. Transmission electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography demonstrated that the P122A and I124A mutations induce severe structural defects in the immature Gag lattice and abrogate conical core formation. Propagation of the P122A and I124A mutants in T-cell lines led to the selection of compensatory mutations within CA. Our findings demonstrate that the CA PPIP(122-125) loop comprises a structural element critical for the formation of the immature Gag lattice. Capsid (CA) plays multiple roles in the HIV-1 replication cycle. CA-CA domain interactions are responsible for multimerization of the Gag polyprotein at virus assembly sites, and in the mature virion, CA monomers assemble into a conical core that encapsidates the viral RNA genome. Multiple CA regions that contribute to the assembly and release of HIV-1 particles have been mapped and investigated. Here, we identified and characterized a Pro-rich loop in CA that is important for the formation of the immature Gag lattice. Changes in this region disrupt viral production and abrogate the formation of infectious, mature virions. Propagation of the mutants in culture led to the selection of second-site compensatory mutations within CA. These results expand our knowledge of the assembly and maturation steps in the viral replication cycle and may be relevant for development of antiviral drugs targeting CA."

Only little is known about external or intrinsic factors that govern  genomic adaptation. Here, by conducting longitudinal genome analyses of 10 new  clinical isolates, we uncovered important differences in gene copy number among genetically highly related strains and revealed gain and loss of gene copies as potential drivers of long-term environmental adaptation in the field. In contrast, chromosome rather than gene amplification was associated with short-term environmental adaptation to  culture. Karyotypic solutions were highly reproducible but unique for a given strain, suggesting that chromosome amplification is under positive selection and dependent on species- and strain-specific intrinsic factors. We revealed a progressive increase in read depth towards the chromosome ends for various  isolates, which may represent a nonclassical mechanism of telomere maintenance that can preserve integrity of chromosome ends during selection for fast  growth. Together our data draw a complex picture of  genomic adaptation in the field and in culture, which is driven by a combination of intrinsic genetic factors that generate strain-specific phenotypic variations, which are under environmental selection and allow for fitness gain. Protozoan parasites of the genus  cause severe human and veterinary diseases worldwide, termed leishmaniases. A hallmark of  biology is its capacity to adapt to a variety of unpredictable fluctuations inside its human host, notably pharmacological interventions, thus, causing drug resistance. Here we investigated mechanisms of environmental adaptation using a comparative genomics approach by sequencing 10 new clinical isolates of the , , and  complexes that were sampled across eight distinct geographical regions. Our data provide new evidence that parasites adapt to environmental change in the field and in culture through a combination of chromosome and gene amplification that likely causes phenotypic variation and drives parasite fitness gains in response to environmental constraints. This novel form of gene expression regulation through genomic change compensates for the absence of classical transcriptional control in these early-branching eukaryotes and opens new venues for biomarker discovery."

            "#text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of neural progenitor cells (NPCs)  is associated with neurological disorders, such as microcephaly, but a detailed molecular understanding of ZIKV-induced pathogenesis is lacking. Here we show that  ZIKV infection of human cells, including NPCs, causes disruption of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. NMD is a cellular mRNA surveillance mechanism that is required for normal brain size in mice. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we identified multiple cellular NMD factors that bind to the viral capsid protein, including the central NMD regulator up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1). Endogenous UPF1 interacted with the ZIKV capsid protein in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and capsid expression posttranscriptionally downregulated UPF1 protein levels, a process that we confirmed occurs during ZIKV infection. Cellular fractionation studies show that the ZIKV capsid protein specifically targets nuclear UPF1 for degradation via the proteasome. A further decrease in UPF1 levels by RNAi significantly enhanced ZIKV infection in NPC cultures, consistent with a model in which NMD restricts ZIKV infection in the fetal brain. We propose that ZIKV, via the capsid protein, has evolved a strategy to lower UPF1 levels and dampen antiviral activities of NMD, which in turn contributes to neuropathology  Zika virus (ZIKV) is a significant global health threat, as infection has been linked to serious neurological complications, including microcephaly. Using a human stem cell-derived neural progenitor model system, we find that a critical cellular quality control process called the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway is disrupted during ZIKV infection. Importantly, disruption of the NMD pathway is a known cause of microcephaly and other neurological disorders. We further identify an interaction between the capsid protein of ZIKV and up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1), the master regulator of NMD, and show that ZIKV capsid targets UPF1 for degradation. Together, these results offer a new mechanism for how ZIKV infection can cause neuropathology in the developing brain."

            "#text": "Recent reports suggest that mosaic-like sequences within the  (ultiple ransferable esistance) efflux pump locus of , likely originating from commensal  sp. by transformation, can increase the ability of gonococci to resist structurally diverse antimicrobials. Thus, acquisition of numerous nucleotide changes within the  gene encoding the transcriptional repressor (MtrR) of the  efflux pump-encoding operon or overlapping promoter region for both along with those that cause amino acid changes in the MtrD transporter protein were recently reported to decrease gonococcal susceptibility to numerous antimicrobials, including azithromycin (Azi) (C. B. Wadsworth, B. J. Arnold, M. R. A. Satar, and Y. H. Grad, mBio 9:e01419-18, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01419-18). We performed detailed genetic and molecular studies to define the mechanistic basis for why such strains can exhibit decreased susceptibility to MtrCDE antimicrobial substrates, including Azi. We report that a strong -acting transcriptional impact of a single nucleotide change within the -35 hexamer of the  promoter as well gain-of-function amino acid changes at the C-terminal region of MtrD can mechanistically account for the decreased antimicrobial susceptibility of gonococci with a mosaic-like  locus. Historically, after introduction of an antibiotic for treatment of gonorrhea, strains of  emerge that display clinical resistance due to spontaneous mutation or acquisition of resistance genes. Genetic exchange between members of the  genus occurring by transformation can cause significant changes in gonococci that impact the structure of an antibiotic target or expression of genes involved in resistance. The results presented here provide a framework for understanding how mosaic-like DNA sequences from commensal  that recombine within the gonococcal  efflux pump locus function to decrease bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobials, including antibiotics used in therapy of gonorrhea."

            "#text": "Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple-sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches; 2 of the branches include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (-) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, in particular, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy. The majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than was attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the existing taxonomy of RNA viruses."

Our study results highlight the relevance of the interactions of this eukaryotic pathogen with bacteria, a poorly understood aspect of the biology of this important human parasite. is a parasitic protozoan of the human urogenital tract that causes trichomoniasis, a very common sexually transmitted disease. Despite residing extracellularly and in close association with the vaginal bacteria (i.e., the microbiota), very little is known about the nature of the parasite-bacterium interactions. Our study showed that this parasite had acquired genes from bacteria which retained their original function. They produce active enzymes capable of degrading peptidoglycan, a unique polymer of the bacterial cell envelope, helping the parasite to outcompete bacteria in mixed cultures. This study was the first to show that a laterally acquired group of genes enables a eukaryotic mucosal pathogen to control bacterial population. We highlight the importance of understanding the interactions between pathogens and microbiota, as the outcomes of these interactions are increasingly understood to have important implications on health and disease."

            "#text": "produces a class C β-lactamase (e.g., PDC-3) that robustly hydrolyzes early generation cephalosporins often at the diffusion limit; therefore, bacteria possessing these β-lactamases are resistant to many β-lactam antibiotics. In response to this significant clinical threat, ceftolozane, a 3' aminopyrazolium cephalosporin, was developed. Combined with tazobactam, ceftolozane promised to be effective against multidrug-resistant  Alarmingly, Ω-loop variants of the PDC β-lactamase (V213A, G216R, E221K, E221G, and Y223H) were identified in ceftolozane/tazobactam-resistant  clinical isolates. Herein, we demonstrate that the  strain expressing the E221K variant of PDC-3 had the highest minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against a panel of β-lactam antibiotics, including ceftolozane and ceftazidime, a cephalosporin that differs in structure largely in the R2 side chain. The  values of the E221K variant for both substrates were equivalent, whereas the  for ceftolozane (341 ± 64 µM) was higher than that for ceftazidime (174 ± 20 µM). Timed mass spectrometry, thermal stability, and equilibrium unfolding studies revealed key mechanistic insights. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations identified conformational changes in the E221K variant Ω-loop, where a hidden pocket adjacent to the catalytic site opens and stabilizes ceftolozane for efficient hydrolysis. Encouragingly, the diazabicyclooctane β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam restored susceptibility to ceftolozane and ceftazidime in cells producing the E221K variant. In addition, a boronic acid transition state inhibitor, LP-06, lowered the ceftolozane and ceftazidime MICs by 8-fold for the E221K-expressing strain. Understanding these structural changes in evolutionarily selected variants is critical toward designing effective β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor therapies for  infections. The presence of β-lactamases (e.g., PDC-3) that have naturally evolved and acquired the ability to break down β-lactam antibiotics (e.g., ceftazidime and ceftolozane) leads to highly resistant and potentially lethal  infections. We show that wild-type PDC-3 β-lactamase forms an acyl enzyme complex with ceftazidime, but it cannot accommodate the structurally similar ceftolozane that has a longer R2 side chain with increased basicity. A single amino acid substitution from a glutamate to a lysine at position 221 in PDC-3 (E221K) causes the tyrosine residue at 223 to adopt a new position poised for efficient hydrolysis of both cephalosporins. The importance of the mechanism of action of the E221K variant, in particular, is underscored by its evolutionary recurrences in multiple bacterial species. Understanding the biochemical and molecular basis for resistance is key to designing effective therapies and developing new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations."

Since the nutrient compositions of human cells are not always conducive to meningococci,  needs to exploit nutrients from host environments. In the present study, the utilization of cysteine by the meningococcal cysteine transport system (CTS) was analyzed for the pathogenesis of meningococcal infections. A  strain deficient in one of the three  genes annotated as encoding cysteine-binding protein () exhibited approximately 100-fold less internalization into human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) than the wild-type strain. This deficiency was restored by complementation with the three  genes together, and the infectious phenotype of HBMEC internalization correlated with cysteine uptake activity. However, efficient accumulation of ezrin was observed beneath the  mutant. The intracellular survival of the  mutant in HBMEC was markedly reduced, whereas equivalent reductions of glutathione concentrations and of resistance to reactive oxygens species in the  mutant were not found. The  mutant grew well in complete medium but not in synthetic medium supplemented with less than 300 μM cysteine. Taking cysteine concentrations in human cells and other body fluids, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid, into consideration, the present results collectively suggest that the meningococcal CTS is crucial for the acquisition of cysteine from human cells and participates in meningococcal nutrient virulence. colonizes at a nasopharynx of human as a unique host and has many strains that are auxotrophs for amino acids for their growth. To cause invasive meningococcal diseases (IMD) such as sepsis and meningitis,  passes through epithelial and endothelial barriers and infiltrates into blood and cerebrospinal fluid as well as epithelial and endothelial cells. However, meningococcal nutrients, including cysteine, become less abundant when it more deeply infiltrates the human body even during inflammation, such that  has to acquire nutrients in order to survive/persist, disseminate, and proliferate in humans. This was the first study to examine the relationship between meningococcal cysteine acquisition and the pathogenesis of meningococcal infections. The results of the present study provide insights into the mechanisms by which pathogens with auxotrophs acquire nutrients in hosts and may also contribute to the development of treatments and prevention strategies for IMD."

            "#text": "Over 80% of travelers from the United Kingdom to the Indian subcontinent acquire CTX-M-producing  (CTX-M-EC), but the mechanism of CTX-M-EC acquisition is poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the dynamics of CTX-M-EC acquisition in healthy travelers and how this relates to populations of non-CTX-M-EC in the fecal microbiome. This is a prospective observational study of healthy volunteers traveling from the United Kingdom to South Asia. Fecal samples were collected pre- and post-travel at several time points up to 12 months post-travel. A toothpicking experiment was used to determine the proportion of cephalosporin-sensitive  in fecal samples containing CTX-M-EC. MLST and SNP type of pre-travel and post-travel  were deduced by WGS. CTX-M-EC was acquired by 89% (16/18) of volunteers. Polyclonal acquisition of CTX-M-EC was seen in 8/15 volunteers (all had >3 STs across post-travel samples), suggesting multiple acquisition events. Indistinguishable CTX-M-EC clones (zero SNPs apart) are detectable in serial fecal samples up to 7 months after travel, indicating stable maintenance in the fecal microbiome on return to the United Kingdom in the absence of selective pressure. CTX-M-EC-containing samples were often co-colonized with novel, non-CTX-M strains after travel, indicating that acquisition of non-CTX-M-EC occurs alongside CTX-M-EC. The same pre-travel non-CTX-M strains (<10 SNPs apart) were found in post-travel fecal samples after CTX-M-EC had been lost, suggesting return of the fecal microbiome to the pre-travel state and long-term persistence of minority strains in travelers who acquire CTX-M-EC. strains which produce CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are endemic as colonizers of humans and in the environment in South Asia. This study demonstrates that acquisition of CTX-M-producing  (CTX-M-EC) in travelers from the United Kingdom to South Asia is polyclonal, which is likely due to multiple acquisition events from contaminated food and drinking water during travel. CTX-M-EC frequently persists in the fecal microbiome for at least 1 year after acquisition, often alongside newly acquired non-CTX-M  strains. In travelers who acquire CTX-M-EC, pre-travel non-CTX-M  remains as a minority population in the gut until the CTX-M-EC strains are lost. The non-CTX-M strains are then reestablished as the predominant  population. This study has shed light on the dynamics of CTX-M-EC acquisition, colonization, and loss after travel. Future work involving manipulation of nonvirulent resident  could be used to prevent colonization with antibiotic-resistant ."

Further understanding its mechanisms of protection may allow the development of improved second-generation vaccines.

They demonstrated that immunization impairs sporozoite motility and entry into blood vessels. Furthermore, they established that challenge experiments performed using a dermal route conferred greater protection than intravenous challenge in immunized mice. Thus, the dermal challenge approach captures the additional protective mechanisms occurring in the dermis that reflect the natural physiology of infection. Those studies highlighted the fascinating biology of skin-stage sporozoites and provided additional insights into vaccine-induced protection."

As infectious disease discovery research has declined among large pharmaceutical companies, the potential payoff of repurposing has become attractive. From these efforts, the triphenylethylene class of selective estrogen receptor modulators related to tamoxifen has shown activity against a wide range of medically important human pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. Because it has activity against many pathogens affecting people in resource-limited areas of the world, TAM and related drugs may be particularly useful. Here, we review the , , and mechanistic studies of the anti-infective activity of tamoxifen, toremifene, clomiphene, and their analogs. We also discuss the pharmacologic properties of this privileged scaffold and its potential utility in treating infectious diseases."

Rather, mRNA binding proteins, which impact processes such as transcript stability and translation efficiency, are the predominant regulators of gene expression. Arginine methylation is a posttranslational modification that preferentially targets RNA binding proteins and is, therefore, likely to have a substantial impact on  biology. The data presented here demonstrate that cells depleted of  PRMT1 (PRMT1), a major type I protein arginine methyltransferase, exhibit decreased virulence in an animal model. To understand the basis of this phenotype, quantitative global proteomics was employed to measure protein steady-state levels in cells lacking PRMT1. The approach revealed striking changes in proteins involved in energy metabolism. Most prominent were a decrease in glycolytic enzyme abundance and an increase in proline degradation pathway components, changes that resemble the metabolic remodeling that occurs during  life cycle progression. The work describes several RNA binding proteins whose association with mRNA was altered in PRMT1-depleted cells, and a large number of PRMT1-interacting proteins, thereby highlighting potential PRMT1 substrates. Many proteins involved in the  starvation stress response were found to interact with PRMT1, prompting analysis of the response of PRMT1-depleted cells to nutrient deprivation. Indeed, depletion of PRMT1 strongly hinders the ability of  to form cytoplasmic mRNA granules under starvation conditions. Finally, this work shows that PRMT1 itself binds nucleic acids  and , a feature completely novel to protein arginine methyltransferases. infection causes human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, a disease with a nearly 100% fatality rate when untreated. Current drugs are expensive, toxic, and highly impractical to administer, prompting the community to explore various unique aspects of  biology in search of better treatments. In this study, we identified the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT), PRMT1, as a factor that modulates numerous aspects of  biology. These include glycolysis and life cycle progression signaling, both of which are being intensely researched toward identification of potential drug targets. Our data will aid research in those fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time a direct association of a PRMT with nucleic acids, a finding we believe could translate to other organisms, including humans, thereby impacting research in fields as distant as human cancer biology and immune response modulation."

            "#text": "Daptomycin, a calcium-dependent lipopeptide antibiotic whose full mode of action is still not entirely understood, has become a standard-of-care agent for treating methicillin-resistant  (MRSA) infections. Daptomycin-resistant (DAP-R)  mutants emerge during therapy, featuring isolates which in most cases possess point mutations in the  gene. MprF is a bifunctional bacterial resistance protein that synthesizes the positively charged lipid lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (LysPG) and translocates it subsequently from the inner membrane leaflet to the outer membrane leaflet. This process leads to increased positive  surface charge and reduces susceptibility to cationic antimicrobial peptides and cationic antibiotics. We characterized the most commonly reported MprF mutations in DAP-R  strains in a defined genetic background and found that only certain mutations, including the frequently reported T345A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), can reproducibly cause daptomycin resistance. Surprisingly, T345A did not alter LysPG synthesis, LysPG translocation, or the  cell surface charge. MprF-mediated DAP-R relied on a functional flippase domain and was restricted to daptomycin and a related cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, friulimicin B, suggesting that the mutations modulate specific interactions with these two antibiotics. Notably, the T345A mutation led to weakened intramolecular domain interactions of MprF, suggesting that daptomycin and friulimicin resistance-conferring mutations may alter the substrate range of the MprF flippase to directly translocate these lipopeptide antibiotics or other membrane components with crucial roles in the activity of these antimicrobials. Our study points to a new mechanism used by  to resist calcium-dependent lipopeptide antibiotics and increases our understanding of the bacterial phospholipid flippase MprF. Ever since daptomycin was introduced to the clinic, daptomycin-resistant isolates have been reported. In most cases, the resistant isolates harbor point mutations in MprF, which produces and flips the positively charged phospholipid LysPG. This has led to the assumption that the resistance mechanism relies on the overproduction of LysPG, given that increased LysPG production may lead to increased electrostatic repulsion of positively charged antimicrobial compounds, including daptomycin. Here we show that the resistance mechanism is highly specific and relies on a different process that involves a functional MprF flippase, suggesting that the resistance-conferring mutations may enable the flippase to accommodate daptomycin or an unknown component that is crucial for its activity. Our report provides a new perspective on the mechanism of resistance to a major antibiotic."

            "#text": "Members of the ancient family of Argonaute (Ago) proteins are present in all domains of life. The common feature of Ago proteins is the ability to bind small nucleic acid guides and use them for sequence-specific recognition-and sometimes cleavage-of complementary targets. While eukaryotic Ago (eAgo) proteins are key players in RNA interference and related pathways, the properties and functions of these proteins in archaeal and bacterial species have just started to emerge. We undertook comprehensive exploration of prokaryotic Ago (pAgo) proteins in sequenced genomes and revealed their striking diversity in comparison with eAgos. Many pAgos contain divergent variants of the conserved domains involved in interactions with nucleic acids, while having extra domains that are absent in eAgos, suggesting that they might have unusual specificities in the nucleic acid recognition and cleavage. Many pAgos are associated with putative nucleases, helicases, and DNA binding proteins in the same gene or operon, suggesting that they are involved in target processing. The great variability of pAgos revealed by our analysis opens new ways for exploration of their functions in host cells and for their use as potential tools in genome editing. The eukaryotic Ago proteins and the RNA interference pathways they are involved in are widely used as a powerful tool in research and as potential therapeutics. In contrast, the properties and functions of prokaryotic Ago (pAgo) proteins have remained poorly understood. Understanding the diversity and functions of pAgos holds a huge potential for discovery of new cellular pathways and novel tools for genome manipulations. Only few pAgos have been characterized by structural or biochemical approaches, while previous genomic studies discovered about 300 proteins in archaeal and eubacterial genomes. Since that time the number of bacterial strains with sequenced genomes has greatly expanded, and many previously sequenced genomes have been revised. We undertook comprehensive analysis of pAgo proteins in sequenced genomes and almost tripled the number of known genes of this family. Our research thus forms a foundation for further experimental characterization of pAgo functions that will be important for understanding of the basic biology of these proteins and their adoption as a potential tool for genome engineering in the future."

            "#text": "The positions of host factors required for viral replication within a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network can be exploited to identify drug targets that are robust to drug-mediated selective pressure. Host factors can physically interact with viral proteins, be a component of virus-regulated pathways (where proteins do not interact with viral proteins), or be required for viral replication but unregulated by viruses. Here, we demonstrate a method of combining human PPI networks with virus-host PPI data to improve antiviral drug discovery for influenza viruses by identifying target host proteins. Analysis shows that influenza virus proteins physically interact with host proteins in network positions significant for information flow, even after the removal of known abundance-degree bias within PPI data. We have isolated a subnetwork of the human PPI network that connects virus-interacting host proteins to host factors that are important for influenza virus replication without physically interacting with viral proteins. The subnetwork is enriched for signaling and immune processes distinct from those associated with virus-interacting proteins. Selecting proteins based on subnetwork topology, we performed an siRNA screen to determine whether the subnetwork was enriched for virus replication host factors and whether network position within the subnetwork offers an advantage in prioritization of drug targets to control influenza virus replication. We found that the subnetwork is highly enriched for target host proteins-more so than the set of host factors that physically interact with viral proteins. Our findings demonstrate that network positions are a powerful predictor to guide antiviral drug candidate prioritization. Integrating virus-host interactions with host protein-protein interactions, we have created a method using these established network practices to identify host factors (i.e., proteins) that are likely candidates for antiviral drug targeting. We demonstrate that interaction cascades between host proteins that directly interact with viral proteins and host factors that are important to influenza virus replication are enriched for signaling and immune processes. Additionally, we show that host proteins that interact with viral proteins are in network locations of power. Finally, we demonstrate a new network methodology to predict novel host factors and validate predictions with an siRNA screen. Our results show that integrating virus-host proteins interactions is useful in the identification of antiviral drug target candidates."

Eukaryotic cells have evolutionarily conserved DNA damage checkpoint surveillance systems. We previously reported that a unique transcription factor, Bdr1, whose expression is strongly induced by the protein kinase Rad53 governs DNA damage responses by controlling the expression of DNA repair genes in the basidiomycetous fungus  However, the regulatory mechanism of the Rad53-dependent DNA damage signal cascade and its function in pathogenicity remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Rad53 is required for DNA damage response and is phosphorylated by two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like kinases, Tel1 and Mec1, in response to DNA damage stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Rad53 regulates the expression of several DNA repair genes in response to gamma radiation. We found that expression of , another effector kinase involved in the DNA damage response, is regulated by Rad53 and that  deletion rendered cells highly susceptible to DNA damage stress. Nevertheless,  expression is regulated by Rad53, but not Chk1, indicating that DNA damage signal cascades mediated by Rad53 and Chk1 exhibit redundant and distinct functions. We found that perturbation of both  and  attenuated the virulence of , perhaps by promoting phagosome maturation within macrophage, reducing melanin production, and increasing susceptibility to oxidative stresses. Furthermore, deletion of both  and  increased susceptibility to certain antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B. This report provides insight into the regulatory mechanism of fungal DNA damage repair systems and their functional relationship with fungal virulence and antifungal drug susceptibility. Genome instability is detrimental for living things because it induces genetic disorder diseases and transfers incorrect genome information to descendants. Therefore, living organisms have evolutionarily conserved signaling networks to sense and repair DNA damage. However, how the DNA damage response pathway is regulated for maintaining the genome integrity of fungal pathogens and how this contributes to their pathogenicity remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the DNA damage response pathway in the basidiomycete pathogen , which causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals, with an average of 223,100 infections leading to 181,100 deaths reported annually. Here, we found that perturbation of Rad53- and Chk1-dependent DNA damage response pathways attenuated the virulence of  and increased its susceptibility to certain antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin B and flucytosine. Therefore, our work paves the way to understanding the important role of human fungal DNA damage networks in pathogenesis and antifungal drug susceptibility."

            "#text": "is a human pathogen responsible for high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recurrent infections with this bacterium are common, suggesting that  thwarts the development of sterilizing immunity.  strains that cause disease in humans produce up to five different bicomponent toxins (leukocidins) that target and lyse neutrophils, innate immune cells that represent the first line of defense against  infections. However, little is known about the role of leukocidins in blunting adaptive immunity. Here, we explored the effects of leukocidins on human dendritic cells (DCs), antigen-presenting cells required for the development of adaptive immunity. Using an  infection model of primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, we found that , including strains from different clonal complexes and drug resistance profiles, effectively kills DCs despite efficient phagocytosis. Although all purified leukocidins could kill DCs, infections with live bacteria revealed that  targets and kills DCs primarily via the activity of leukocidin LukAB. Moreover, using coculture experiments performed with DCs and autologous CD4 T lymphocytes, we found that LukAB inhibits DC-mediated activation and proliferation of primary human T cells. Taken together, the data determined in the study reveal a novel immunosuppressive strategy of  whereby the bacterium blunts the development of adaptive immunity via LukAB-mediated injury of DCs. Antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) fulfill an indispensable role in the development of adaptive immunity by producing proinflammatory cytokines and presenting microbial antigens to lymphocytes to trigger a faster, specific, and long-lasting immune response. Here, we studied the effect of  toxins on human DCs. We discovered that the leukocidin LukAB hinders the development of adaptive immunity by targeting human DCs. The ability of  to blunt the function of DCs could help explain the high frequency of recurrent  infections. Taken together, the results from this study suggest that therapeutically targeting the  leukocidins may boost effective innate and adaptive immune responses by protecting innate leukocytes, enabling proper antigen presentation and T cell activation."

The precise choreography required is even more complex in species with more than one chromosome. The alpha subgroup of bacteria contains not only one of the best-studied bacterial species, , but also several species with more than one chromosome.  is an alphaproteobacterium with two chromosomes, but, unlike , it divides symmetrically rather than buds and lacks the complex CtrA-dependent control mechanism. By examining the Ori and Ter regions of both chromosomes and associated ParA and ParB proteins relative to cell division proteins FtsZ and MipZ, we have identified a different pattern of chromosome segregation and cell division. The pattern of chromosome duplication and segregation resembles that of , not that of , with duplication of the origin and terminus regions of chromosome 2 controlled by chromosome 1. Key proteins are localized to different sites compared to  OriC1 and ParB1 are localized to the old pole, while MipZ and FtsZ localize to the new pole. Movement of ParB1 to the new pole following chromosome duplication releases FtsZ, which forms a ring at midcell, but, unlike reports for other species, MipZ monomers do not form a gradient but oscillate between poles, with the nucleotide-bound monomer and the dimer localizing to midcell. MipZ dimers form a single ring (with a smaller diameter) close to the FtsZ ring at midcell and constrict with the FtsZ ring. Overproduction of the dimer form results in filamentation, suggesting that MipZ dimers are regulating FtsZ activity and thus septation. This is an unexpected role for MipZ and provides a new model for the integration of chromosome segregation and cell division. Cell division has to be coordinated with chromosome segregation to ensure the stable inheritance of genetic information. We investigated this coordination in the multichromosome bacterium  By examining the origin and terminus regions of the two chromosomes, the ParA-like ATPase MipZ and FtsZ, we showed that chromosome 1 appears to be the \"master\" chromosome connecting DNA segregation and cell division, with MipZ being critical for coordination. MipZ shows an unexpected localization pattern, with MipZ monomers interacting with ParB of the chromosome 1 at the cell poles whereas MipZ dimers colocalize with FtsZ at midcell during constriction, both forming dynamic rings. These data suggest that MipZ has roles in  in both controlling septation and coordinating chromosome segregation with cell division."

UCYN-A is uncultivated and is an unusual unicellular cyanobacterium because it lacks many metabolic functions, including oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon fixation, which are typical in cyanobacteria. It is now presumed to be an obligate symbiont of haptophytes closely related to  N-fixing cyanobacteria use different strategies to avoid inhibition of N fixation by the oxygen evolved in photosynthesis. Most unicellular cyanobacteria temporally separate the two incompatible activities by fixing N only at night, but, surprisingly, UCYN-A appears to fix N during the day. The goal of this study was to determine how the unicellular UCYN-A strain coordinates N fixation and general metabolism compared to other marine cyanobacteria. We found that UCYN-A has distinct daily cycles of many genes despite the fact that it lacks two of the three circadian clock genes found in most cyanobacteria. We also found that the transcription patterns in UCYN-A are more similar to those in marine cyanobacteria that are capable of aerobic N fixation in the light, such as  and heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria, than to those in  or  species, which are more closely related to unicellular marine cyanobacteria evolutionarily. Our findings suggest that the symbiotic interaction has resulted in a shift of transcriptional regulation to coordinate UCYN-A metabolism with that of the phototrophic eukaryotic host, thus allowing efficient coupling of N fixation (by the cyanobacterium) to the energy obtained from photosynthesis (by the eukaryotic unicellular alga) in the light. The symbiotic N-fixing cyanobacterium UCYN-A, which is closely related to , and its eukaryotic algal host have been shown to be globally distributed and important in open-ocean N fixation. These unique cyanobacteria have reduced metabolic capabilities, even lacking genes for oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon fixation. Cyanobacteria generally use energy from photosynthesis for nitrogen fixation but require mechanisms for avoiding inactivation of the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase enzyme by ambient oxygen (O) or the O evolved through photosynthesis. This study showed that symbiosis between the N-fixing cyanobacterium UCYN-A and its eukaryotic algal host has led to adaptation of its daily gene expression pattern in order to enable daytime aerobic N fixation, which is likely more energetically efficient than fixing N at night, as found in other unicellular marine cyanobacteria."

ProQ has been shown to target hundreds of transcripts, including mRNAs from many virulence regions, but its role, if any, in bacterial pathogenesis has not been studied. Here, using a Dual RNA-seq approach to profile ProQ-dependent gene expression changes as  infects human cells, we reveal dysregulation of bacterial motility, chemotaxis, and virulence genes which is accompanied by altered MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling in the host. Comparison with the other major RNA chaperone in , Hfq, reinforces the notion that these two global RNA-binding proteins work in parallel to ensure full virulence. Of newly discovered infection-associated ProQ-bound small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs), we show that the 3'UTR-derived sRNA STnc540 is capable of repressing an infection-induced magnesium transporter mRNA in a ProQ-dependent manner. Together, this comprehensive study uncovers the relevance of ProQ for  pathogenesis and highlights the importance of RNA-binding proteins in regulating bacterial virulence programs. The protein ProQ has recently been discovered as the centerpiece of a previously overlooked \"third domain\" of small RNA-mediated control of gene expression in bacteria. As  work continues to reveal molecular mechanisms, it is also important to understand how ProQ affects the life cycle of bacterial pathogens as these pathogens infect eukaryotic cells. Here, we have determined how ProQ shapes  virulence and how the activities of this RNA-binding protein compare with those of Hfq, another central protein in RNA-based gene regulation in this and other bacteria. To this end, we apply global transcriptomics of pathogen and host cells during infection. In doing so, we reveal ProQ-dependent transcript changes in key virulence and host immune pathways. Moreover, we differentiate the roles of ProQ from those of Hfq during infection, for both coding and noncoding transcripts, and provide an important resource for those interested in ProQ-dependent small RNAs in enteric bacteria."

However, the specific hyphal factors that enable  to activate the Nlrp3 inflammasome in primary macrophages remain to be revealed. Here, we identify candidalysin, a peptide derived from the hypha-specific  gene, as a fungal trigger for Nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated maturation and secretion of IL-1β from primary macrophages. Direct peptide administration experiments showed that candidalysin was sufficient for inducing secretion of mature IL-1β from macrophages in an Nlrp3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Conversely, infection experiments using candidalysin-deficient  showed that candidalysin crucially contributed to the capacity of this fungus to induce maturation and secretion of IL-1β from primary macrophages. These complementary observations identify the expression of candidalysin as one of the molecular mechanisms by which hyphal transformation equips  with its proinflammatory capacity to elicit the release of bioactive IL-1β from macrophages. Candidiasis is a potentially lethal condition that is caused by systemic dissemination of , a common fungal commensal residing mostly on mucosal surfaces. The transition of  from an innocuous commensal to an opportunistic pathogen goes hand in hand with its morphological transformation from a fungus to a hyphal appearance. On the one hand, the latter manifestation enables  to penetrate tissues, while on the other hand, the expression of many hypha-specific genes also endows it with the capacity to trigger particular cytokine responses. The Nlrp3 inflammasome is a crucial component of the innate immune system that provokes release of the IL-1β cytokine from myeloid cells upon encountering  hyphae.

            "#text": "Flaviviruses include a diverse group of medically important viruses that cycle between mosquitoes and humans. During this natural process of switching hosts, each species imposes different selective forces on the viral population. Using dengue virus (DENV) as model, we found that paralogous RNA structures originating from duplications in the viral 3' untranslated region (UTR) are under different selective pressures in the two hosts. These RNA structures, known as dumbbells (DB1 and DB2), were originally proposed to be enhancers of viral replication. Analysis of viruses obtained from infected mosquitoes showed selection of mutations that mapped in DB2. Recombinant viruses carrying the identified variations confirmed that these mutations greatly increase viral replication in mosquito cells, with low or no impact in human cells. Use of viruses lacking each of the DB structures revealed opposite viral phenotypes. While deletion of DB1 reduced viral replication about 10-fold, viruses lacking DB2 displayed a great increase of fitness in mosquitoes, confirming a functional diversification of these similar RNA elements. Mechanistic analysis indicated that DB1 and DB2 differentially modulate viral genome cyclization and RNA replication. We found that a pseudoknot formed within DB2 competes with long-range RNA-RNA interactions that are necessary for minus-strand RNA synthesis. Our results support a model in which a functional diversification of duplicated RNA elements in the viral 3' UTR is driven by host-specific requirements. This study provides new ideas for understanding molecular aspects of the evolution of RNA viruses that naturally jump between different species. Flaviviruses constitute the most relevant group of arthropod-transmitted viruses, including important human pathogens such as the dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The natural alternation of these viruses between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts shapes the viral genome population, which leads to selection of different viral variants with potential implications for epidemiological fitness and pathogenesis. However, the selective forces and mechanisms acting on the viral RNA during host adaptation are still largely unknown. Here, we found that two almost identical tandem RNA structures present at the viral 3' untranslated region are under different selective pressures in the two hosts. Mechanistic studies indicated that the two RNA elements, known as dumbbells, contain sequences that overlap essential RNA cyclization elements involved in viral RNA synthesis. The data support a model in which the duplicated RNA structures differentially evolved to accommodate distinct functions for viral replication in the two hosts."

            "#text": "Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential constituent of the bacterial cell wall. During cell division, PG synthesis localizes at midcell under the control of a multiprotein complex, the divisome, allowing the safe formation of two new cell poles and separation of daughter cells. Genetic studies in  pointed out that FtsBLQ and FtsN participate in the regulation of septal PG (sPG) synthesis; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remained largely unknown. Here we show that FtsBLQ subcomplex directly interacts with the PG synthase PBP1b and with the subcomplex FtsW-PBP3, mainly via FtsW. Strikingly, we discovered that FtsBLQ inhibits the glycosyltransferase activity of PBP1b and that this inhibition was antagonized by the PBP1b activators FtsN and LpoB. The same results were obtained in the presence of FtsW-PBP3. Moreover, using a simple thioester substrate (S2d), we showed that FtsBLQ also inhibits the transpeptidase domain of PBP3 but not of PBP1b. As the glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase activities of PBP1b are coupled and PBP3 activity requires nascent PG substrate, the results suggest that PBP1b inhibition by FtsBLQ will block sPG synthesis by these enzymes, thus maintaining cell division as repressed until the maturation of the divisome is signaled by the accumulation of FtsN, which triggers sPG synthesis and the initiation of cell constriction. These results confirm that PBP1b plays an important role in  cell division and shed light on the specific role of FtsN, which seems to counterbalance the inhibitory effect of FtsBLQ to restore PBP1b activity. Bacterial cell division is governed by a multiprotein complex called divisome, which facilitates a precise cell wall synthesis at midcell and daughter cell separation. Protein-protein interactions and activity studies using different combinations of the septum synthesis core of the divisome revealed that the glycosyltransferase activity of PBP1b is repressed by FtsBLQ and that the presence of FtsN or LpoB suppresses this inhibition. Moreover, FtsBLQ also inhibits the PBP3 activity on a thioester substrate. These results provide enzymatic evidence of the regulation of the peptidoglycan synthase PBP1b and PBP3 within the divisome. The results confirm that PBP1b plays an important role in  cell division and shed light on the specific role of FtsN, which functions to relieve the repression on PBP1b by FtsBLQ and to initiate septal peptidoglycan synthesis."

            "#text": "The human persistent and oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was one of the first viruses that were described to express viral microRNAs (miRNAs). These have been proposed to modulate many host and viral functions, but their predominant role  has remained unclear. We compared recombinant EBVs expressing or lacking miRNAs during  infection of mice with reconstituted human immune system components and found that miRNA-deficient EBV replicates to lower viral titers with decreased frequencies of proliferating EBV-infected B cells. In response, activated cytotoxic EBV-specific T cells expand to lower frequencies than during infection with miRNA-expressing EBV. However, when we depleted CD8 T cells the miRNA-deficient virus reached similar viral loads as wild-type EBV, increasing by more than 200-fold in the spleens of infected animals. Furthermore, CD8 T cell depletion resulted in lymphoma formation in the majority of animals after miRNA-deficient EBV infection, while no tumors emerged when CD8 T cells were present. Thus, miRNAs mainly serve the purpose of immune evasion from T cells  and could become a therapeutic target to render EBV-associated malignancies more immunogenic. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects the majority of the human population and usually persists asymptomatically within its host. Nevertheless, EBV is the causative agent for infectious mononucleosis (IM) and for lymphoproliferative disorders, including Burkitt and Hodgkin lymphomas. The immune system of the infected host is thought to prevent tumor formation in healthy virus carriers. EBV was one of the first viruses described to express miRNAs, and many host and viral targets were identified for these  However, their role during EBV infection  remained unclear. This work is the first to describe that EBV miRNAs mainly increase viremia and virus-associated lymphomas through dampening antigen recognition by adaptive immune responses in mice with reconstituted immune responses. Currently, there is no prophylactic or therapeutic treatment to restrict IM or EBV-associated malignancies; thus, targeting EBV miRNAs could promote immune responses and limit EBV-associated pathologies."

Here, we show that Ume6 stability is regulated by two parallel E3 ubiquitin ligases, SCF and Ubr1, in response to CO and O, respectively. To uncover the CO signaling pathway that regulates Ume6 stability, we performed genetic screens for mutants unable to respond to CO for sustained filamentation. We find that the type 2C protein phosphatase Ptc2 is specifically required for CO-induced stabilization of Ume6 and hyphal elongation. In contrast, the cyclin-dependent kinase Ssn3 is found to be required for Ume6 phosphorylation and degradation in atmospheric CO Furthermore, we find that Ssn3 is dephosphorylated in 5% CO in a Ptc2-dependent manner, whereas deletion of  has no effect on Ssn3 phosphorylation in air.

We have previously shown that closely related pneumococci (of the same capsular serotype and multilocus sequence type [ST]) can display distinct pathogenic profiles in mice that correlate with clinical isolation site (e.g., blood versus ear), suggesting stable niche adaptation within a clonal lineage. This has provided an opportunity to identify determinants of disease tropism. Genomic analysis identified 17 and 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or insertions/deletions in protein coding sequences between blood and ear isolates of serotype 14 ST15 and serotype 3 ST180, respectively. SNPs in raffinose uptake and utilization genes ( or ) were detected in both serotypes/lineages. Ear isolates were consistently defective in growth in media containing raffinose as the sole carbon source, as well as in expression of raffinose pathway genes , , and , relative to their serotype/ST-matched blood isolates. Similar differences were also seen between serotype 23F ST81 blood and ear isolates. Analysis of  allelic exchange mutants of the serotype 14 ST15 blood and ear isolates demonstrated that the SNP in  was entirely responsible for their distinct  phenotypes and was also the determinant of differential tropism for the lungs versus ear and brain in a mouse intranasal challenge model. These data suggest that the ability of pneumococci to utilize raffinose determines the nature of disease. is a component of the commensal nasopharyngeal microflora of humans, but from this reservoir, it can progress to localized or invasive disease with a frequency that translates into massive global morbidity and mortality. However, the factors that govern the switch from commensal to pathogen, as well as those that determine disease tropism, are poorly understood. Here we show that capacity to utilize raffinose can determine the nature of the disease caused by a given pneumococcal strain. Moreover, our findings provide an interesting example of convergent evolution, whereby pneumococci belonging to two unrelated serotypes/lineages exhibit SNPs in separate genes affecting raffinose uptake and utilization that correlate with distinct pathogenic profiles  This further underscores the critical role of differential carbohydrate metabolism in the pathogenesis of localized versus invasive pneumococcal disease."

            "#text": "The streamlining hypothesis is generally used to explain the genomic reduction events related to the small genome size of free-living bacteria like marine bacteria SAR11. However, our current understanding of the correlation between bacterial genome size and environmental adaptation relies on too few species. It is still unclear whether there are other paths leading to genomic reduction in free-living bacteria. The genome size of marine free-living bacteria of the genus  belonging to the order  () is much smaller than the size of related genomes from bacteria in the same order. Comparative genomic and physiological analyses showed that the genomic reduction pattern in this genus is different from that of the classical SAR11 lineage. Genomic reduction reconstruction and substrate utilization profile showed that  spp. lost a large number of genes related to carbohydrate utilization, and instead they specialized on using proteinaceous resources. Here we propose a new hypothesis to explain genomic reduction in this genus; we propose that trophic specialization increasing the metabolic efficiency for using one kind of substrate but reducing the substrate utilization spectrum could result in bacterial genomic reduction, which would be not uncommon in nature. This hypothesis was further tested in another free-living genus, , which also shows dramatic genomic reduction. These findings highlight that trophic specialization is potentially an important path leading to genomic reduction in some marine free-living bacteria, which is distinct from the classical lineages like SAR11. The streamlining hypothesis is usually used to explain the genomic reduction events in free-living bacteria like SAR11. However, we find that the genomic reduction phenomenon in the bacterial genus  is different from that in SAR11. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis to explain genomic reduction in this genus based on trophic specialization that could result in genomic reduction, which would be not uncommon in nature. Not only can the trophic specialization hypothesis explain the genomic reduction in the genus , but it also sheds new light on our understanding of the genomic reduction processes in other free-living bacterial lineages."

            "#text": "The long-term response of microbial communities to the microgravity environment of space is not yet fully understood. Of special interest is the possibility that members of these communities may acquire antibiotic resistance. In this study,  cells were grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) conditions for over 1,000 generations (1000G) using chloramphenicol treatment between cycles to prevent contamination. The results were compared with data from an earlier control study done under identical conditions using steam sterilization between cycles rather than chloramphenicol. The sensitivity of the final 1000G-adapted strain to a variety of antibiotics was determined using Vitek analysis. In addition to resistance to chloramphenicol, the adapted strain acquired resistance to cefalotin, cefuroxime, cefuroxime axetil, cefoxitin, and tetracycline. In fact, the resistance to chloramphenicol and cefalotin persisted for over 110 generations despite the removal of both LSMMG conditions and trace antibiotic exposure. Genome sequencing of the adapted strain revealed 22 major changes, including 3 transposon-mediated rearrangements (TMRs). Two TMRs disrupted coding genes (involved in bacterial adhesion), while the third resulted in the deletion of an entire segment (14,314 bp) of the genome, which includes 14 genes involved with motility and chemotaxis. These results are in stark contrast with data from our earlier control study in which cells grown under the identical conditions without antibiotic exposure never acquired antibiotic resistance. Overall, LSMMG does not appear to alter the antibiotic stress resistance seen in microbial ecosystems not exposed to microgravity. Stress factors experienced during space include microgravity, sleep deprivation, radiation, isolation, and microbial contamination, all of which can promote immune suppression (1, 2). Under these conditions, the risk of infection from opportunistic pathogens increases significantly, particularly during long-term missions (3). If infection occurs, it is important that the infectious agent should not be antibiotic resistant. Minimizing the occurrence of antibiotic resistance is, therefore, highly desirable. To facilitate this, it is important to better understand the long-term response of bacteria to the microgravity environment. This study demonstrated that the use of antibiotics as a preventive measure could be counterproductive and would likely result in persistent resistance to that antibiotic. In addition, unintended resistance to other antimicrobials might also occur as well as permanent genome changes that might have other unanticipated and undesirable consequences."

            "#text": "Enteroviruses are a common cause of respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, and multiple subtypes, including poliovirus, can cause neurologic disease. In recent years, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has been associated with serious neurologic illnesses, including acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), frequently preceded by respiratory disease. A cluster of 11 suspect cases of pediatric AFM was identified in September 2016 in Phoenix, AZ. To determine if these cases were associated with EV-D68, we performed multiple genomic analyses of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) material from the patients, including real-time PCR and amplicon sequencing targeting the EV-D68 VP1 gene and unbiased microbiome and metagenomic sequencing. Four of the 11 patients were classified as confirmed cases of AFM, and an additional case was classified as probable AFM. Real-time PCR and amplicon sequencing detected EV-D68 virus RNA in the three AFM patients from which NP swabs were collected, as well as in a fourth patient diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, a disease that commonly follows bacterial or viral infections, including enterovirus. No other obvious etiological causes for AFM were identified by 16S or RNA and DNA metagenomic sequencing in these cases, strengthening the likelihood that EV-D68 is an etiological factor. Herpes simplex viral DNA was detected in the CSF of the fourth case of AFM and in one additional suspect case from the cluster. Multiple genomic techniques, such as those described here, can be used to diagnose patients with suspected EV-D68 respiratory illness, to aid in AFM diagnosis, and for future EV-D68 surveillance and epidemiology. Enteroviruses frequently result in respiratory and gastrointestinal illness; however, multiple subtypes, including poliovirus, can cause severe neurologic disease. Recent biennial increases (i.e., 2014, 2016, and 2018) in cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis have led to speculations that other enteroviruses, specifically enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), are emerging to fill the niche that was left from poliovirus eradication. A cluster of 11 suspect cases of pediatric acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) was identified in 2016 in Phoenix, AZ. Multiple genomic analyses identified the presence of EV-D68 in the majority of clinical AFM cases. Beyond limited detection of herpesvirus, no other likely etiologies were found in the cluster. These findings strengthen the likelihood that EV-D68 is a cause of AFM and show that the rapid molecular assays developed for this study are useful for investigations of AFM and EV-D68."

While it is clear that DNA methylation can silence HIV proviral expression in  latency models, its correlation with HIV persistence and expression  is ambiguous, particularly in persons living with HIV (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Several factors potentially contribute to discrepancies between results in the literature, including differences in integration sites, functional proviral load, sampling bias, and stochastic PCR amplification. Recent studies into genomic features of cytosine methylation sites in mammalian genes offer potentially significant insights into this mechanism. Here, we discuss the importance of these factors in the context of the HIV."

However, there has been no systematic investigation of this phenomenon in the absence of confounding factors such as nutrient status and growth rate, and there is little hard evidence for a causal relationship. Whether transcription is fundamentally responsive to prevailing cellular energetic conditions via sensing of intracellular purine nucleotides, independently of specific nutrition, remains an important question. The controlled nutritional environment of chemostat culture revealed a strong correlation between ATP and GTP abundance and the transcription of genes required for growth. Short pathways for the inducible and futile consumption of ATP or GTP were engineered into , permitting analysis of the transcriptional effect of an increased demand for these nucleotides. During steady-state growth using the fermentable carbon source glucose, the futile consumption of ATP led to a decrease in intracellular ATP concentration but an increase in GTP and the guanylate energy charge (GEC). Expression of transcripts encoding proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, and those controlled by promoters subject to SWI/SNF-dependent chromatin remodelling, was correlated with these nucleotide pool changes. Similar nucleotide abundance changes were observed using a nonfermentable carbon source, but an effect on the growth-associated transcriptional programme was absent. Induction of the GTP-cycling pathway had only marginal effects on nucleotide abundance and gene transcription. The transcriptional response of respiring cells to glucose was dampened in chemostats induced for ATP cycling, but not GTP cycling, and this was primarily associated with altered adenine nucleotide levels. This paper investigates whether, independently of the supply of any specific nutrient, gene transcription responds to the energy status of the cell by monitoring ATP and GTP levels. Short pathways for the inducible and futile consumption of ATP or GTP were engineered into the yeast , and the effect of an increased demand for these purine nucleotides on gene transcription was analyzed. The resulting changes in transcription were most consistently associated with changes in GTP and GEC levels, although the reprogramming in gene expression during glucose repression is sensitive to adenine nucleotide levels. The results show that GTP levels play a central role in determining how genes act to respond to changes in energy supply and that any comprehensive understanding of the control of eukaryotic gene expression requires the elucidation of how changes in guanine nucleotide abundance are sensed and transduced to alter the global pattern of transcription."

            "#text": "Homologous recombination (HR) enables the exchange of genetic material between and within species. Recent studies suggest that this process plays a major role in the microevolution of microbial genomes, contributing to core genome homogenization and to the maintenance of cohesive population structures. However, we still have a very poor understanding of the possible adaptive roles of intraspecific HR and of the factors that determine its differential impact across clades and lifestyles. Here we used a unified methodological framework to assess HR in 338 complete genomes from 54 phylogenetically diverse and representative prokaryotic species, encompassing different lifestyles and a broad phylogenetic distribution. Our results indicate that lifestyle and presence of restriction-modification (RM) machineries are among the main factors shaping HR patterns, with symbionts and intracellular pathogens having the lowest HR levels. Similarly, the size of exchanged genomic fragments correlated with the presence of RM and competence machineries. Finally, genes exchanged by HR showed functional enrichments which could be related to adaptations to different environments and ecological strategies. Taken together, our results clarify the factors underlying HR impact and suggest important adaptive roles of genes exchanged through this mechanism. Our results also revealed that the extent of genetic exchange correlated with lifestyle and some genomic features. Moreover, the genes in exchanged regions were enriched for functions that reflected specific adaptations, supporting identification of HR as one of the main evolutionary mechanisms shaping prokaryotic core genomes. Microbial populations exchange genetic material through a process called homologous recombination. Although this process has been studied in particular organisms, we lack an understanding of its differential impact over the genome and across microbes with different life-styles. We used a common analytical framework to assess this process in a representative set of microorganisms. Our results uncovered important trends. First, microbes with different lifestyles are differentially impacted, with endosymbionts and obligate pathogens being those less prone to undergo this process. Second, certain genetic elements such as restriction-modification systems seem to be associated with higher rates of recombination. Most importantly, recombined genomes show the footprints of natural selection in which recombined regions preferentially contain genes that can be related to specific ecological adaptations. Taken together, our results clarify the relative contributions of factors modulating homologous recombination and show evidence for a clear a role of this process in shaping microbial genomes and driving ecological adaptations."

            "#text": "Friend virus (FV) is a naturally occurring mouse retrovirus that infects dividing cells of the hematopoietic lineage, including antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The infection of APCs by viruses often induces their dysfunction, and it has been shown that FV infection reduces the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to prime critical CD8 T cell responses. Nonetheless, mice mount vigorous CD8 T cell responses, so we investigated whether B cells might serve as alternative APCs during FV infection. Direct  analysis of B cells from FV-infected mice revealed that infected but not uninfected B cells upregulated expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD40, as well as major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules. Furthermore,  studies showed that, compared to uninfected B cells from the same mice, the FV-infected B cells had significantly enhanced APC function, as measured by their capacity to prime CD8 T cell activation and proliferation. Thus, in contrast to DCs, infection of B cells with FV enhanced their APC capacity and ability to stimulate the CD8 T cell responses essential for virus control. FV infections also induce the activation and expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), so it was of interest to determine the impact of Tregs on B cell activation. The upregulation of costimulatory molecule expression and APC function of B cells was even more strongly enhanced by  depletion of regulatory T cells than infection. Thus, Tregs exert potent homeostatic suppression of B cell activation that is partially overcome by FV infection. The primary role of B cells in immunity is considered the production of pathogen-specific antibodies, but another, less-well-studied, function of B cells is to present foreign antigens to T cells to stimulate their activation and proliferation. Dendritic cells (DCs) are considered the most important antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for CD8 T cells, but DCs lose APC function when infected with Friend virus (FV), a model retrovirus of mice. Interestingly, B cells were better able to stimulate CD8 T cell responses when they were infected with FV. We also found that the activation status of B cells under homeostatic conditions was potently modulated by regulatory T cells. This study illustrates an important link between B cell and T cell responses and illustrates an additional mechanism by which regulatory T cells suppress critical T cell responses during viral infections."

            "#text": "Several host cell nuclear factors are known to restrict herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) replication, but their mechanisms of action remain to be defined. Interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and the nuclear domain 10-associated proteins, such as promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, localize to input viral genomes, but they are also capable of restricting progeny viral transcription. In this study, we used structured illumination microscopy to show that after HSV DNA replication, IFI16 forms nuclear filamentous structures on DNA within a subset of nuclear replication compartments in HSV-1 ICP0-null mutant virus-infected human cells. The ability to form filaments in different cell types correlates with the efficiency of restriction, and the kinetics of filament formation and epigenetic changes are similar. Thus, both are consistent with the filamentous structures being involved in epigenetic silencing of viral progeny DNA. IFI16 filaments recruit other restriction factors, including PML, Sp100, and ATRX, to aid in the restriction. Although the filaments are only in a subset of the replication compartments, IFI16 reduces the levels of elongation-competent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in all replication compartments. Therefore, we propose that IFI16 filaments with associated restriction factors that form in replication compartments constitute a \"restrictosome\" structure that signals in  and  to silence the progeny viral DNA throughout the infected cell nucleus. The IFI16 filamentous structure may constitute the first known nuclear supramolecular organizing center for signaling in the cell nucleus. Mammalian cells exhibit numerous strategies to recognize and contain viral infections. The best-characterized antiviral responses are those that are induced within the cytosol by receptors that activate interferon responses or shut down translation. Antiviral responses also occur in the nucleus, yet these intranuclear innate immune responses are poorly defined at the receptor-proximal level. In this study, we explored the ability of cells to restrict infection by assembling viral DNA into transcriptionally silent heterochromatin within the nucleus. We found that the IFI16 restriction factor forms filaments on DNA within infected cells. These filaments recruit antiviral restriction factors to prevent viral replication in various cell types. Mechanistically, IFI16 filaments inhibit the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to viral genes. We propose that IFI16 filaments with associated restriction factors constitute a \"restrictosome\" structure that can signal to other parts of the nucleus where foreign DNA is located that it should be silenced."

            "#text": "Butanol production by  is accompanied by coproduction of acetone and ethanol, which reduces the yield of butanol and increases the production cost. Here, we report development of several clostridial aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AAD) variants showing increased butanol selectivity by a series of design and analysis procedures, including random mutagenesis, substrate specificity feature analysis, and structure-based butanol selectivity design. The butanol/ethanol ratios (B/E ratios) were dramatically increased to 17.47 and 15.91 g butanol/g ethanol for AAD and AAD, respectively, which are 5.8-fold and 5.3-fold higher than the ratios obtained with the wild-type AAD. The much-increased B/E ratio obtained was due to the dramatic reduction in ethanol production (0.59 ± 0.01 g/liter) that resulted from engineering the substrate binding chamber and the active site of AAD. This protein design strategy can be applied generally for engineering enzymes to alter substrate selectivity. Renewable biofuel represents one of the answers to solving the energy crisis and climate change problems. Butanol produced naturally by clostridia has superior liquid fuel characteristics and thus has the potential to replace gasoline. Due to the lack of efficient genetic manipulation tools, however, clostridial strain improvement has been slower than improvement of other microorganisms. Furthermore, fermentation coproducing various by-products requires costly downstream processing for butanol purification. Here, we report the results of enzyme engineering of aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AAD) to increase butanol selectivity. A metabolically engineered  strain expressing the engineered aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase gene was capable of producing butanol at a high level of selectivity."

Epidemic strains of  often dominate within the lungs of individual CF patients, but how they achieve this is poorly understood. One way that strains of  can compete is by producing chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, called pyocins. Three major classes of pyocin have been identified in : soluble pyocins (S types) and tailocins (R and F types). In this study, we investigated the distribution of S- and R-type pyocins in 24 clinical strains isolated from individual CF patients and then focused on understanding their roles in interstrain competition. We found that (i) each strain produced only one R-pyocin type, but the number of S-pyocins varied between strains, (ii) R-pyocins were generally important for strain dominance during competition assays in planktonic cultures and biofilm communities in strains with both disparate R- and S-pyocin subtypes, and (iii) purified R-pyocins demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against established biofilms. Our work provides support for a role played by R-pyocins in the competition between  strains and helps explain why certain strains and lineages of  dominate and displace others during CF infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of exploiting R-pyocins for therapeutic gains in an era when antibiotic resistance is a global concern. A major clinical problem caused by , is chronic biofilm infection of the lungs in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Epidemic  strains dominate and displace others during CF infection, but these intraspecies interactions remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that R-pyocins (bacteriocins) are important factors in driving competitive interactions in biofilms between  strains isolated from different CF patients. In addition, we found that these phage-like pyocins are inhibitory against mature biofilms of susceptible strains. This highlights the potential of R-pyocins as antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents at a time when new antimicrobial therapies are desperately needed."

We recently conducted transcriptome analyses comparing normal (i.e., healthy) cervical tissue samples with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cervical cancer tissue samples and identified 614 differentially expressed protein-coding transcripts which are enriched in cancer-related pathways and consist of 95 known RBPs. We verified the altered expression of 26 genes with a cohort of 72 cervical samples, including 24 normal cervical samples, 25 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) and CIN3 samples, and 23 cervical cancer tissue samples. LY6K (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus K), FAM83A (family member with sequence similarity 83), CELSR3, ASF1B, IQGAP3, SEMA3F, CLDN10, MSX1, CXCL5, ASRGL1, ELAVL2, GRB7, KHSRP, NOVA1, PTBP1, and RNASEH2A were identified as novel candidate genes associated with cervical lesion progression and carcinogenesis. HPV16 or HPV18 infection was found to alter the expression of 8 RBP genes (CDKN2A, ELAVL2, GRB7, HSPB1, KHSRP, NOVA1, PTBP1, and RNASEH2A) in human vaginal and foreskin keratinocytes. Both viral E6 and E7 decreased NOVA1 expression, but only E7 increased the expression of RNASEH2A in an E2F1-dependent manner. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) directs RNASEH2 activity with respect to DNA replication by removing the RNA primers to promote Okazaki fragment maturation, and two factors are closely associated with neoplasia progression. Therefore, we predict that the induction of expression of RNASEH2A via viral E7 and E2F1 may promote DNA replication and cancer cell proliferation. High-risk HPV infections lead to development of cervical cancer. This study identified the differential expression of 16 novel genes (LY6K, FAM83A, CELSR3, ASF1B, IQGAP3, SEMA3F, CLDN10, MSX1, CXCL5, ASRGL1, ELAVL2, GRB7, KHSRP, NOVA1, PTBP1, and RNASEH2A) in HPV-infected cervical tissue samples and keratinocytes. Eight of these genes (CDKN2A, ELAVL2, GRB7, HSPB1, KHSRP, NOVA1, PTBP1, and RNASEH2A) encode RNA-binding proteins. Further studies indicated that both HPV16 and HPV18 infections lead to the aberrant expression of selected RBP-encoding genes. We found that viral E6 and E7 decrease NOVA1 expression but that E7 increases RNASEH2A expression via E2F1. The altered expression of these genes may be utilized as biomarkers for high-risk (HR)-HPV carcinogenesis and progression."

            "#text": "Phosphatases, including phytases, play a major role in cell metabolism, phosphorus cycle, biotechnology, and pathogenic processes. Nevertheless, their discovery by functional metagenomics is challenging. Here, soil metagenomic libraries were successfully screened for genes encoding phosphatase activity. In this context, we report the largest number and diversity of phosphatase genes derived from functional metagenome analysis. Two of the detected gene products carry domains which have never been associated with phosphatase activity before. One of these domains, the SNARE-associated domain DedA, harbors a so-far-overlooked motif present in numerous bacterial SNARE-associated proteins. Our analysis revealed a previously unreported phytase activity of the alkaline phosphatase and sulfatase superfamily (cl23718) and of purple acid phosphatases from nonvegetal origin. This suggests that the classical concept comprising four classes of phytases should be modified and indicates high performance of our screening method for retrieving novel types of phosphatases/phytases hidden in metagenomes of complex environments. Phosphorus (P) is a key element involved in numerous cellular processes and essential to meet global food demand. Phosphatases play a major role in cell metabolism and contribute to control the release of P from phosphorylated organic compounds, including phytate. Apart from the relationship with pathogenesis and the enormous economic relevance, phosphatases/phytases are also important for reduction of phosphorus pollution. Almost all known functional phosphatases/phytases are derived from cultured individual microorganisms. We demonstrate here for the first time the potential of functional metagenomics to exploit the phosphatase/phytase pools hidden in environmental soil samples. The recovered diversity of phosphatases/phytases comprises new types and proteins exhibiting largely unknown characteristics, demonstrating the potential of the screening method for retrieving novel target enzymes. The insights gained into the unknown diversity of genes involved in the P cycle highlight the power of function-based metagenomic screening strategies to study Earth's phosphatase pools."

            "#text": "Membrane computing is a bio-inspired computing paradigm whose devices are the so-called membrane systems or P systems. The P system designed in this work reproduces complex biological landscapes in the computer world. It uses nested \"membrane-surrounded entities\" able to divide, propagate, and die; to be transferred into other membranes; to exchange informative material according to flexible rules; and to mutate and be selected by external agents. This allows the exploration of hierarchical interactive dynamics resulting from the probabilistic interaction of genes (phenotypes), clones, species, hosts, environments, and antibiotic challenges. Our model facilitates analysis of several aspects of the rules that govern the multilevel evolutionary biology of antibiotic resistance. We examined a number of selected landscapes where we predict the effects of different rates of patient flow from hospital to the community and vice versa, the cross-transmission rates between patients with bacterial propagules of different sizes, the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics, and the antibiotics and dosing found in the opening spaces in the microbiota where resistant phenotypes multiply. We also evaluated the selective strengths of some drugs and the influence of the time 0 resistance composition of the species and bacterial clones in the evolution of resistance phenotypes. In summary, we provide case studies analyzing the hierarchical dynamics of antibiotic resistance using a novel computing model with reciprocity within and between levels of biological organization, a type of approach that may be expanded in the multilevel analysis of complex microbial landscapes. The work that we present here represents the culmination of many years of investigation in looking for a suitable methodology to simulate the multihierarchical processes involved in antibiotic resistance. Everything started with our early appreciation of the different independent but embedded biological units that shape the biology, ecology, and evolution of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Genes, plasmids carrying these genes, cells hosting plasmids, populations of cells, microbial communities, and host's populations constitute a complex system where changes in one component might influence the other ones. How would it be possible to simulate such a complexity of antibiotic resistance as it occurs in the real world? Can the process be predicted, at least at the local level? A few years ago, and because of their structural resemblance to biological systems, we realized that membrane computing procedures could provide a suitable frame to approach these questions. Our manuscript describes the first application of this modeling methodology to the field of antibiotic resistance and offers a bunch of examples-just a limited number of them in comparison with the possible ones to illustrate its unprecedented explanatory power."

Despite the increased prevalence of  infections, the mechanisms governing drug resistance remain largely elusive. In diverse fungi, the evolution of drug resistance is enabled by the essential molecular chaperone Hsp90, which stabilizes key regulators of cellular responses to drug-induced stress. Hsp90 also orchestrates temperature-dependent morphogenesis in , a key virulence trait. However, the role of Hsp90 in the pathobiology of  remains unknown. In order to study regulatory functions of Hsp90 in , we placed  under the control of a doxycycline-repressible promoter to enable transcriptional repression. We found that Hsp90 is essential for growth in  and that it enables tolerance of clinical isolates with respect to the azoles, which inhibit biosynthesis of the membrane sterol ergosterol. High-level azole resistance was independent of Hsp90 but dependent on the ABC transporter , deletion of which resulted in abrogated resistance. Strikingly, we discovered that  undergoes a morphogenetic transition from yeast to filamentous growth in response to  depletion or cell cycle arrest but not in response to other cues that induce  filamentation. Finally, we observed that this developmental transition is associated with global transcriptional changes, including the induction of cell wall-related genes. Overall, this report provides a novel insight into mechanisms of drug tolerance and resistance in  and describes a developmental transition in response to perturbation of a core regulator of protein homeostasis.

However, the mechanisms governing drug resistance and virulence in this organism remain largely unexplored. In this study, we adapted a conditional expression system to modulate the transcription of an essential gene, , which regulates antifungal resistance and virulence in diverse fungal pathogens. We showed that Hsp90 is essential for growth in  and is important for tolerance of the clinically important azole antifungals, which block ergosterol biosynthesis. Further, we established that the Cdr1 efflux transporter regulates azole resistance. Finally, we discovered that  transitions from yeast to filamentous growth in response to Hsp90 inhibition, accompanied by global transcriptional remodeling.

However, the host's long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, not commonly found in the membranes of bacterial pathogens, also have significant broad-spectrum antibacterial potential. Of these, the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) and the omega-3 fatty acid decosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are highly abundant; hence, we investigated their effects on the multidrug-resistant human pathogen  Our analyses reveal that AA and DHA incorporate into the  bacterial membrane and impact bacterial fitness and membrane integrity, with DHA having a more pronounced effect. Through transcriptional profiling and mutant analyses, we show that the  β-oxidation pathway plays a protective role against AA and DHA, by limiting their incorporation into the phospholipids of the bacterial membrane. Furthermore, our study identified a second bacterial membrane protection system mediated by the AdeIJK efflux system, which modulates the lipid content of the membrane via direct efflux of lipids other than AA and DHA, thereby providing a novel function for this major efflux system in  This is the first study to examine the antimicrobial effects of host fatty acids on  and highlights the potential of AA and DHA to protect against  infections. A shift in the Western diet since the industrial revolution has resulted in a dramatic increase in the consumption of omega-6 fatty acids, with a concurrent decrease in the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids. This decrease in omega-3 fatty acid consumption has been associated with significant disease burden, including increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. Here we provide evidence that DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, has superior antimicrobial effects upon the highly drug-resistant pathogen , thereby providing insights into one of the potential health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids. The identification and characterization of two novel bacterial membrane protective mechanisms against host fatty acids provide important insights into  adaptation during disease. Furthermore, we describe a novel role for the major multidrug efflux system AdeIJK in  membrane maintenance and lipid transport. This core function, beyond drug efflux, increases the appeal of AdeIJK as a therapeutic target."

In the major human pathogen , hundreds of sRNAs have been identified; however, only a few have been characterized in detail. In this study, we investigate the role of the sRNA Teg41 in  virulence. We demonstrate that Teg41, an sRNA divergently transcribed from the locus that encodes the cytolytic alpha phenol-soluble modulin (αPSM) peptides, plays a critical role in αPSM production. Overproduction of Teg41 leads to an increase in αPSM levels and a corresponding increase in hemolytic activity from  cells and cell-free culture supernatants. To identify regions of Teg41 important for its function, we performed an  RNA-RNA interaction analysis which predicted an interaction between the 3' end of Teg41 and the αPSM transcript. Deleting a 24-nucleotide region from the  genome, corresponding to the 3' end of Teg41, led to a 10-fold reduction in αPSM-dependent hemolytic activity and attenuation of virulence in a murine abscess model of infection. Restoration of hemolytic activity in the Teg41Δ3' strain was possible by expressing full-length Teg41 in  Restoration of hemolytic activity was also possible by expressing the 3' end of Teg41, suggesting that this region of Teg41 is necessary and sufficient for αPSM-dependent hemolysis.

The importance of Teg41 is highlighted by the fact that a strain containing a deletion in the 3' end of Teg41 produces significantly less αPSMs and is attenuated for virulence in a mouse abscess model of infection.

            "#text": "Gram-negative bacteria have a tripartite cell envelope with the cytoplasmic membrane (CM), a stress-bearing peptidoglycan (PG) layer, and the asymmetric outer membrane (OM) containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet. Cells must tightly coordinate the growth of their complex envelope to maintain cellular integrity and OM permeability barrier function. The biogenesis of PG and LPS relies on specialized macromolecular complexes that span the entire envelope. In this work, we show that  cells are capable of avoiding lysis when the transport of LPS to the OM is compromised, by utilizing LD-transpeptidases (LDTs) to generate 3-3 cross-links in the PG. This PG remodeling program relies mainly on the activities of the stress response LDT, LdtD, together with the major PG synthase PBP1B, its cognate activator LpoB, and the carboxypeptidase PBP6a. Our data support a model according to which these proteins cooperate to strengthen the PG in response to defective OM synthesis. In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane protects the cell against many toxic molecules, and the peptidoglycan layer provides protection against osmotic challenges, allowing bacterial cells to survive in changing environments. Maintaining cell envelope integrity is therefore a question of life or death for a bacterial cell. Here we show that  cells activate the LD-transpeptidase LdtD to introduce 3-3 cross-links in the peptidoglycan layer when the integrity of the outer membrane is compromised, and this response is required to avoid cell lysis. This peptidoglycan remodeling program is a strategy to increase the overall robustness of the bacterial cell envelope in response to defects in the outer membrane."

Employing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen to find host factors required for EMCV infection, we identified a role for ADAM9 in EMCV infection. CRISPR-mediated deletion of ADAM9 in multiple human cell lines rendered the cells highly resistant to EMCV infection and cell death. Primary fibroblasts from ADAM9 KO mice were also strongly resistant to EMCV infection and cell death. In contrast, ADAM9 KO and WT cells were equally susceptible to infection with other viruses, including the picornavirus Coxsackie virus B. ADAM9 KO cells failed to produce viral progeny when incubated with EMCV. However, bypassing EMCV entry into cells through delivery of viral RNA directly to the cytosol yielded infectious EMCV virions from ADAM9 KO cells, suggesting that ADAM9 is not required for EMCV replication post-entry. These findings establish that ADAM9 is required for the early stage of EMCV infection, likely for virus entry or viral genome delivery to the cytosol. Viral myocarditis is a leading cause of death in the United States, contributing to numerous unexplained deaths in people ≤35 years old. Enteroviruses contribute to many cases of human myocarditis. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection causes viral myocarditis in rodent models, but its receptor requirements have not been fully identified. CRISPR-Cas9 screens can identify host dependency factors essential for EMCV infection and enhance our understanding of key events that follow viral infection, potentially leading to new strategies for preventing viral myocarditis. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identified isintegrin nd etalloproteinase 9 domain (ADAM9) as a major factor required for the early stages of EMCV infection in both human and murine infection."

On the other hand, mating might occur within clonal populations and allow the combination of advantageous traits that were acquired by individual cells to adapt to adverse conditions. We have investigated if parasexual recombination may be involved in the evolution of highly drug-resistant strains exhibiting multiple resistance mechanisms against fluconazole, an antifungal drug that is commonly used to treat infections by  Growth of strains that were heterozygous for  and different fluconazole resistance mutations in the presence of the drug resulted in the emergence of derivatives that had become homozygous for the mutated allele and the mating type locus and exhibited increased drug resistance. When / and α/α cells of these strains were mixed in all possible combinations, we could isolate mating products containing the genetic material from both parents. The initial mating products did not exhibit higher drug resistance than their parental strains, but further propagation under selective pressure resulted in the loss of the wild-type alleles and increased fluconazole resistance. Therefore, fluconazole treatment not only selects for resistance mutations but also promotes genomic alterations that confer mating competence, which allows cells in an originally clonal population to exchange individually acquired resistance mechanisms and generate highly drug-resistant progeny. Sexual reproduction is an important mechanism in the evolution of species, since it allows the combination of advantageous traits of individual members in a population. The pathogenic yeast  is a diploid organism that normally propagates in a clonal fashion, because heterozygosity at the mating type locus () inhibits mating between cells. Here we show that  cells that have acquired drug resistance mutations during treatment with the commonly used antifungal agent fluconazole rapidly develop further increased resistance by genome rearrangements that result in simultaneous loss of heterozygosity for the mutated allele and the mating type locus. This enables the drug-resistant cells of a population to switch to the mating-competent opaque morphology and mate with each other to combine different individually acquired resistance mechanisms. The tetraploid mating products reassort their merged genomes and, under selective pressure by the drug, generate highly resistant progeny that have retained the advantageous mutated alleles. Parasexual propagation, promoted by stress-induced genome rearrangements that result in the acquisition of mating competence in cells with adaptive mutations, may therefore be an important mechanism in the evolution of  populations."

Inhibition of mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase by nutrient deprivation promotes autophagy and lysosome fusion, as well as activation of the transcription factors TFE3 and TFEB (TFE3/B), which upregulates expression of lysosomal genes. Here, we report that  inhibits mTORC1 as evidenced by impaired localization of mTORC1 to endolysosomal membranes and decreased phosphorylation of elF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and S6 kinase 1 in infected cells. Infected cells exhibit increased amounts of autophagy-related proteins protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and p62 as well as of activated TFE3. However,  did not accelerate autophagy or block autophagic flux triggered by cell starvation. Activation of autophagy or transcription by TFE3/B increased CCV expansion without enhancing bacterial replication. By contrast, knockdown of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or TSC2, which hyperactivates mTORC1, impaired CCV expansion and bacterial replication. Together, these data demonstrate that specific inhibition of mTORC1 by , but not amplified cell catabolism via autophagy, is required for optimal pathogen replication. These data reveal a complex interplay between lysosomal function and host cell metabolism that regulates  intracellular growth. is an intracellular pathogenic bacterium that replicates within a lysosomal vacuole. Biogenesis of the -containing vacuole (CCV) requires effector proteins delivered into the host cell cytosol by the type 4B secretion system (T4BSS). Modifications to lysosomal physiology required for pathogen replication within the CCV are poorly understood. Mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master kinase that regulates lysosome structure and function. Nutrient deprivation inhibits mTORC1, which promotes cell catabolism in the form of accelerated autophagy and increased lysosome biosynthesis. Here, we report that  growth is enhanced by T4BSS-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 that does not activate autophagy. Canonical inhibition of mTORC1 by starvation or inhibitor treatment that induces autophagic flux does not benefit  growth. Furthermore, hyperactivation of mTORC1 impairs bacterial replication. These findings indicate that  inhibition of mTORC1 without accelerated autophagy promotes bacterial growth."

Previous studies have shown that the holdfast is composed of carbohydrate-based material and identified a number of genes required for holdfast development. However, incomplete information about its chemical structure, biosynthetic genes, and regulatory principles has limited progress in understanding the mechanism of holdfast synthesis. We leveraged the adhesive properties of the holdfast to perform a saturating screen for genes affecting attachment to cheesecloth over a multiday time course. Using similarities in the temporal profiles of mutants in a transposon library, we defined discrete clusters of genes with related effects on cheesecloth colonization. Holdfast synthesis, flagellar motility, type IV pilus assembly, and smooth lipopolysaccharide (SLPS) production represented key classes of adhesion determinants. Examining these clusters in detail allowed us to predict and experimentally define the functions of multiple uncharacterized genes in both the holdfast and SLPS pathways. In addition, we showed that the pilus and the flagellum control holdfast synthesis separately by modulating the holdfast inhibitor  This report defines a set of genes contributing to adhesion that includes newly discovered genes required for holdfast biosynthesis and attachment. Our data provide evidence that the holdfast contains a complex polysaccharide with at least four monosaccharides in the repeating unit and underscore the central role of cell polarity in mediating attachment of  to surfaces. Bacteria routinely encounter biotic and abiotic materials in their surrounding environments, and they often enlist specific behavioral programs to colonize these materials. Adhesion is an early step in colonizing a surface.  produces a structure called the holdfast which allows this organism to attach to and colonize surfaces. To understand how the holdfast is produced, we performed a genome-wide search for genes that contribute to adhesion by selecting for mutants that could not attach to cheesecloth. We discovered complex interactions between genes that mediate surface contact and genes that contribute to holdfast development. Our genetic selection identified what likely represents a comprehensive set of genes required to generate a holdfast, laying the groundwork for a detailed characterization of the enzymes that build this specialized adhesin."

While dormancy explains a low-abundance state very well, the mechanisms leading to rare but active microorganisms remain elusive. We used environmental systems biology to genomically and transcriptionally characterize \" Desulfosporosinus infrequens,\" a low-abundance sulfate-reducing microorganism cosmopolitan to freshwater wetlands, where it contributes to cryptic sulfur cycling. We obtained its near-complete genome by metagenomics of acidic peat soil. In addition, we analyzed anoxic peat soil incubated under -like conditions for 50 days by -targeted qPCR and metatranscriptomics. The  population stayed at a constant low abundance under all incubation conditions, averaging 1.2 × 10 16S rRNA gene copies per cm³ soil. In contrast, transcriptional activity of \" Desulfosporosinus infrequens\" increased at day 36 by 56- to 188-fold when minor amendments of acetate, propionate, lactate, or butyrate were provided with sulfate, compared to the no-substrate-control. Overall transcriptional activity was driven by expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, energy metabolism, and stress response but not by expression of genes encoding cell growth-associated processes. Since our results did not support growth of these highly active microorganisms in terms of biomass increase or cell division, they had to invest their sole energy for maintenance, most likely counterbalancing acidic pH conditions. This finding explains how a rare biosphere member can contribute to a biogeochemically relevant process while remaining in a zero-growth state over a period of 50 days. The microbial rare biosphere represents the largest pool of biodiversity on Earth and constitutes, in sum of all its members, a considerable part of a habitat's biomass. Dormancy or starvation is typically used to explain the persistence of low-abundance microorganisms in the environment. We show that a low-abundance microorganism can be highly transcriptionally active while remaining in a zero-growth state for at least 7 weeks. Our results provide evidence that this zero growth at a high cellular activity state is driven by maintenance requirements. We show that this is true for a microbial keystone species, in particular a cosmopolitan but permanently low-abundance sulfate-reducing microorganism in wetlands that is involved in counterbalancing greenhouse gas emissions. In summary, our results provide an important step forward in understanding time-resolved activities of rare biosphere members relevant for ecosystem functions."

            "#text": "Hypoxia is linked to therapeutic resistance and poor clinical prognosis for many tumor entities, including human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cancers. Notably, HPV-positive cancer cells can induce a dormant state under hypoxia, characterized by a reversible growth arrest and strong repression of viral E6/E7 oncogene expression, which could contribute to therapy resistance, immune evasion and tumor recurrence. The present work aimed to gain mechanistic insights into the pathway(s) underlying HPV oncogene repression under hypoxia. We show that E6/E7 downregulation is mediated by hypoxia-induced stimulation of AKT signaling. Ablating AKT function in hypoxic HPV-positive cancer cells by using chemical inhibitors efficiently counteracts E6/E7 repression. Isoform-specific activation or downregulation of AKT1 and AKT2 reveals that both AKT isoforms contribute to hypoxic E6/E7 repression and act in a functionally redundant manner. Hypoxic AKT activation and consecutive E6/E7 repression is dependent on the activities of the canonical upstream AKT regulators phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2). Hypoxic downregulation of E6/E7 occurs, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. Modulation of E6/E7 expression by the PI3K/mTORC2/AKT cascade is hypoxia specific and not observed in normoxic HPV-positive cancer cells. Quantitative proteome analyses identify additional factors as candidates to be involved in hypoxia-induced activation of the PI3K/mTORC2/AKT signaling cascade and in the AKT-dependent repression of the E6/E7 oncogenes under hypoxia. Collectively, these data uncover a functional key role of the PI3K/mTORC2/AKT signaling cascade for viral oncogene repression in hypoxic HPV-positive cancer cells and provide new insights into the poorly understood cross talk between oncogenic HPVs and their host cells under hypoxia. Oncogenic HPV types are major human carcinogens. Under hypoxia, HPV-positive cancer cells can repress the viral E6/E7 oncogenes and induce a reversible growth arrest. This response could contribute to therapy resistance, immune evasion, and tumor recurrence upon reoxygenation. Here, we uncover evidence that HPV oncogene repression is mediated by hypoxia-induced activation of canonical PI3K/mTORC2/AKT signaling. AKT-dependent downregulation of E6/E7 is only observed under hypoxia and occurs, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. Quantitative proteome analyses identify additional factors as candidates to be involved in AKT-dependent E6/E7 repression and/or hypoxic PI3K/mTORC2/AKT activation. These results connect PI3K/mTORC2/AKT signaling with HPV oncogene regulation, providing new mechanistic insights into the cross talk between oncogenic HPVs and their host cells."

            "#text": "Secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) represents a fundamental innate immune response to microbial infection that, at the molecular level, occurs following activation of proteolytic caspases that cleave the immature protein into a secretable form. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the archetypal betaherpesvirus that is invariably capable of lifelong infection through the activity of numerous virally encoded immune evasion phenotypes. Innate immune pathways responsive to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are known to be activated in response to contact between HCMV and host cells. Here, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome editing to demonstrate that the dsDNA receptor bsent n elanoma 2 (AIM2) is required for secretion of IL-1β following HCMV infection. Furthermore, dsDNA-responsive innate signaling induced by HCMV infection that leads to activation of the type I interferon response is also shown, unexpectedly, to play a contributory role in IL-1β secretion. Importantly, we also show that rendering virus particles inactive by UV exposure leads to substantially increased IL-1β processing and secretion and that live HCMV can inhibit this, suggesting the virus encodes factors that confer an inhibitory effect on this response. Further examination revealed that ectopic expression of the immediate early (IE) 86-kDa protein (IE86) is actually associated with a block in transcription of the pro-IL-1β gene and, independently, diminishment of the immature protein. Overall, these results reveal two new and distinct phenotypes conferred by the HCMV IE86 protein, as well as an unusual circumstance in which a single herpesviral protein exhibits inhibitory effects on multiple molecular processes within the same innate immune response. Persistent infection with HCMV is associated with the operation of diverse evasion phenotypes directed at antiviral immunity. Obstruction of intrinsic and innate immune responses is typically conferred by viral proteins either associated with the viral particle or expressed immediately after entry. In line with this, numerous phenotypes are attributed to the HCMV IE86 protein that involve interference with innate immune processes via transcriptional and protein-directed mechanisms. We describe novel IE86-mediated phenotypes aimed at virus-induced secretion of IL-1β. Intriguingly, while many viruses target the function of the molecular scaffold required for IL-1β maturation to prevent this response, we find that HCMV and IE86 target the IL-1β protein specifically. Moreover, we show that IE86 impairs both the synthesis of the IL-1β transcript and the stability of the immature protein. This indicates an unusual phenomenon in which a single viral protein exhibits two molecularly separate evasion phenotypes directed at a single innate cytokine."

            "#text": "The enterovirus genus of the picornavirus family includes a large number of important human pathogens such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus A71, and rhinoviruses. Like all other positive-strand RNA viruses, genome replication of enteroviruses occurs on rearranged membranous structures called replication organelles (ROs). Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KB) is required by all enteroviruses for RO formation. The enteroviral 3A protein recruits PI4KB to ROs, but the exact mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigated the role of acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3) in PI4KB recruitment upon enterovirus replication using ACBD3 knockout (ACBD3) cells. ACBD3 knockout impaired replication of representative viruses from four enterovirus species and two rhinovirus species. PI4KB recruitment was not observed in the absence of ACBD3. The lack of ACBD3 also affected the localization of individually expressed 3A, causing 3A to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the Golgi. Reconstitution of wild-type (wt) ACBD3 restored PI4KB recruitment and 3A localization, while an ACBD3 mutant that cannot bind to PI4KB restored 3A localization, but not virus replication. Consistently, reconstitution of a PI4KB mutant that cannot bind ACBD3 failed to restore virus replication in PI4KB cells. Finally, by reconstituting ACBD3 mutants lacking specific domains in ACBD3 cells, we show that acyl-coenzyme A binding (ACB) and charged-amino-acid region (CAR) domains are dispensable for 3A-mediated PI4KB recruitment and efficient enterovirus replication. Altogether, our data provide new insight into the central role of ACBD3 in recruiting PI4KB by enterovirus 3A and reveal the minimal domains of ACBD3 involved in recruiting PI4KB and supporting enterovirus replication. Similar to all other positive-strand RNA viruses, enteroviruses reorganize host cellular membranes for efficient genome replication. A host lipid kinase, PI4KB, plays an important role in this membrane rearrangement. The exact mechanism of how enteroviruses recruit PI4KB was unclear. Here, we revealed a role of a Golgi-residing protein, ACBD3, as a mediator of PI4KB recruitment upon enterovirus replication. ACBD3 is responsible for proper localization of enteroviral 3A proteins in host cells, which is important for 3A to recruit PI4KB. By testing ACBD3 and PI4KB mutants that abrogate the ACBD3-PI4KB interaction, we showed that this interaction is crucial for enterovirus replication. The importance of specific domains of ACBD3 was evaluated for the first time, and the domains that are essential for enterovirus replication were identified. Our findings open up a possibility for targeting ACBD3 or its interaction with enteroviruses as a novel strategy for the development of broad-spectrum antienteroviral drugs."

In bacteria, cells use various strategies to recognize kin to form social groups and, in some cases, to transition into multicellular life. One strategy relies on a single genetic locus that encodes a variable phenotypic tag (\"greenbeard\") for recognizing other tag bearers. Previously, we discovered a polymorphic cell surface receptor called TraA that directs self-identification through homotypic interactions in the social bacterium  Recognition by TraA leads to cellular resource sharing in a process called outer membrane exchange (OME). A second gene in the  operon, , is also required for OME but is not involved in recognition. Our prior studies of TraA identified only six recognition groups among closely related  isolates. Here we hypothesize that the number of  polymorphisms and, consequently, the diversity of recognition in wild isolates are much greater. To test this hypothesis, we expand the scope of TraA characterization to the order  From genomic sequences within the three suborders of , we identified 90  orthologs. Sequence analyses and functional characterization of  loci suggest that OME is well maintained among diverse myxobacterial taxonomic groups. Importantly, TraA orthologs are highly polymorphic within their variable domain, the region that confers selectivity in self-recognition. We experimentally defined 10 distinct recognition groups and, based on phylogenetic and experimental analyses, predicted >60 recognition groups among the 90  alleles. Taken together, our findings revealed a widespread greenbeard locus that mediates the diversity of self-recognition across the order  Many biological species distinguish self from nonself by using different mechanisms. Higher animals recognize close kin via complex processes that often involve the five senses, cognition, and learning, whereas some microbes achieve self-recognition simply through the activity of a single genetic locus. Here we describe a single locus, , in myxobacteria that governs cell-cell recognition within natural populations. We found that  is widespread across the order  TraA is highly polymorphic among diverse myxobacterial isolates, and such polymorphisms determine selectivity in self-recognition.

Under conditions of immunocompromise, cryptococci disseminate from the lungs to the brain, causing a deadly meningoencephalitis that is difficult and expensive to treat. Cryptococcal adaptation to the harsh lung environment is a critical first step in its pathogenesis, and consequently a compelling topic of study. This adaptation is mediated by a complex transcriptional program that integrates cellular responses to environmental stimuli. Although several key regulators in this process have been examined, one that remains understudied in  is the Mediator complex. In other organisms, this complex promotes transcription of specific genes by increasing assembly of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. We focused on the Kinase Module of Mediator, which consists of cyclin C (Ssn801), cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (Cdk8), Med12, and Med13. This module provides important inhibitory control of Mediator complex assembly and activity. Using transcriptomics, we discovered that Cdk8 and Ssn801 together regulate cryptococcal functions such as the ability to grow on acetate and the response to oxidative stress, both of which were experimentally validated. Deletion of  yielded altered mitochondrial morphology and the dysregulation of genes involved in oxidation-reduction processes. This strain exhibited increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, resulting in an inability of mutant cells to proliferate within phagocytes, decreased lung burdens, and attenuated virulence  These findings increase our understanding of cryptococcal adaptation to the host environment and its regulation of oxidative stress resistance and virulence. is a fungal pathogen that primarily affects severely immunocompromised patients, resulting in 200,000 deaths every year. This yeast occurs in the environment and can establish disease upon inhalation into the lungs of a mammalian host. In this harsh environment it must survive engulfment by host phagocytes, including the oxidative stresses it experiences inside them. To adapt to these challenging conditions,  deploys a variety of regulatory proteins to alter gene expression levels and enhance its ability to survive. We have elucidated the role of a protein complex that regulates the cryptococcal response to oxidative stress, survival within phagocytes, and ability to cause disease. These findings are important because they advance our understanding of cryptococcal disease, which we hope will help in the efforts to control this devastating infection."

            "#text": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) switches between two infection programs, productive (\"lytic\") and latent infection. Some HSV-1 microRNAs (miRNAs) have been hypothesized to help control this switch, and yet little is known about regulation of their expression. Using Northern blot analyses, we found that, despite inherent differences in biogenesis efficiency among six HSV-1 miRNAs, all six exhibited high pre-miRNA/miRNA ratios during lytic infection of different cell lines and, when detectable, in acutely infected mouse trigeminal ganglia. In contrast, considerably lower ratios were observed in latently infected ganglia and in cells transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing the miRNAs, suggesting that HSV-1 lytic infection blocks miRNA biogenesis. This phenomenon is not specific to viral miRNAs, as a host miRNA expressed from recombinant HSV-1 also exhibited high pre-miRNA/miRNA ratios late during lytic infection. The levels of most of the mature miRNAs remained stable during infection in the presence of actinomycin D, indicating that the high ratios are due to inefficient pre-miRNA conversion to miRNA. Cellular fractionation experiments showed that late (but not early) during infection, pre-miRNAs were enriched in the nucleus and depleted in the cytoplasm, indicating that nuclear export was blocked. A mutation eliminating ICP27 expression or addition of acyclovir reduced pre-miRNA/miRNA ratios, but mutations drastically reducing Us11 expression did not. Thus, HSV-1 lytic infection inhibits miRNA biogenesis at the step of nuclear export and does so in an ICP27- and viral DNA synthesis-dependent manner. This mechanism may benefit the virus by reducing expression of repressive miRNAs during lytic infection while permitting elevated expression during latency. Various mechanisms have been identified by which viruses target host small RNA biogenesis pathways to achieve optimal infection outcomes. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a ubiquitous human pathogen whose successful persistence in the host entails both productive (\"lytic\") and latent infection. Although many HSV-1 miRNAs have been discovered and some are thought to help control the lytic/latent switch, little is known about regulation of their biogenesis. By characterizing expression of both pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs under various conditions, this study revealed striking differences in miRNA biogenesis between lytic and latent infection and uncovered a regulatory mechanism that blocks pre-miRNA nuclear export and is dependent on viral protein ICP27 and viral DNA synthesis. This mechanism represents a new virus-host interaction that could limit the repressive effects of HSV-1 miRNAs hypothesized to promote latency and may shed light on the regulation of miRNA nuclear export, which has been relatively unexplored."

            "#text": "Chemotaxis and energy taxis permit directed bacterial movements in gradients of environmental cues. Nitrate is a final electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration and can also serve as a nitrogen source for aerobic growth. Previous studies indicated that bacterial nitrate taxis is mediated by energy taxis mechanisms, which are based on the cytosolic detection of consequences of nitrate metabolism. Here we show that  PAO1 mediates nitrate chemotaxis on the basis of specific nitrate sensing by the periplasmic PilJ domain of the PA2788/McpN chemoreceptor. The presence of nitrate reduced  transcript levels, and McpN-mediated taxis occurred only under nitrate starvation conditions. In contrast to the NarX and NarQ sensor kinases, McpN bound nitrate specifically and showed no affinity for other ligands such as nitrite. We report the three-dimensional structure of the McpN ligand binding domain (LBD) at 1.3-Å resolution in complex with nitrate. Although structurally similar to 4-helix bundle domains, the ligand binding mode differs since a single nitrate molecule is bound to a site on the dimer symmetry axis. As for 4-helix bundle domains, ligand binding stabilized the McpN-LBD dimer. McpN homologues showed a wide phylogenetic distribution, indicating that nitrate chemotaxis is a widespread phenotype. These homologues were particularly abundant in bacteria that couple sulfide/sulfur oxidation with nitrate reduction. This work expands the range of known chemotaxis effectors and forms the basis for the exploration of nitrate chemotaxis in other bacteria and for the study of its physiological role. Nitrate is of central importance in bacterial physiology. Previous studies indicated that movements toward nitrate are due to energy taxis, which is based on the cytosolic sensing of consequences of nitrate metabolism. Here we present the first report on nitrate chemotaxis. This process is initiated by specific nitrate binding to the periplasmic ligand binding domain (LBD) of McpN. Nitrate chemotaxis is highly regulated and occurred only under nitrate starvation conditions, which is helpful information to explore nitrate chemotaxis in other bacteria. We present the three-dimensional structure of the McpN-LBD in complex with nitrate, which is the first structure of a chemoreceptor PilJ-type domain. This structure reveals striking similarities to that of the abundant 4-helix bundle domain but employs a different sensing mechanism. Since McpN homologues show a wide phylogenetic distribution, nitrate chemotaxis is likely a widespread phenomenon with importance for the life cycle of ecologically diverse bacteria."

            "#text": "Nearly all cervical cancers are causally associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). The burden of HPV-associated dysplasias in sub-Saharan Africa is influenced by HIV. To investigate the role of the bacterial microbiome in cervical dysplasia, cytobrush samples were collected directly from cervical lesions of 144 Tanzanian women. The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and deep sequenced. Alpha diversity metrics (Chao1, PD whole tree, and operational taxonomic unit [OTU] estimates) displayed significantly higher bacterial richness in HIV-positive patients ( = 0.01) than in HIV-negative patients. In HIV-positive patients, there was higher bacterial richness in patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) ( = 0.13) than those without lesions. The most abundant OTUs associated with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were , , and  We suggest that a chronic mycoplasma infection of the cervix may contribute to HPV-dependent dysplasia by sustained inflammatory signals. HPV is known to be the causal agent in the majority of cervical cancers. However, the role of the cervical bacterial microbiome in cervical cancer is not clear. To investigate that possibility, we collected cervical cytobrush samples from 144 Tanzanian women and performed deep sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. We found that HIV-positive patients had greater bacterial richness ( = 0.01) than HIV-negative patients. We also observed that women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) had greater cervical bacterial diversity than women with cytologically normal cervices. Data from our precise sampling of cervical lesions leads us to propose that  contributes to a cervical microbiome status that promotes HPV-related cervical lesions. These results suggest a greater influence of the bacterial microbiota on the outcome of HPV infection than previously thought."

Nonetheless, we identified frequent intra- and interspecies exchange of mobile genetic elements (e.g., antibiotic resistance plasmids, novel \"chromids,\" or two different and concurrent type VI secretion systems) that provide high levels of genetic diversity in the population.

However, the genetic factors that differentiate its clinical and environmental strains and its several biotypes remain mostly enigmatic. In this work, we investigated the underlying genomic properties and population dynamics of the  species to elucidate the traits that make these strains emerge as a human pathogen. The acquisition of different ecological determinants could have allowed the development of highly divergent clusters with different lifestyles within the same environment. However, we identified strains from both clusters in the mucosa of aquaculture species, indicating that manmade niches are bringing strains from the two clusters together, posing a potential risk of recombination and of emergence of novel variants. We propose a new evolutionary model that provides a perspective that could be broadly applicable to other pathogenic vibrios and facultative bacterial pathogens to pursue strategies to prevent their infections."

Apicomplexan parasites have long been recognized to produce alternatively spliced transcripts for some genes and can produce multiple protein products that are essential for parasite growth. Recent approaches are now providing more wide-ranging surveys of the extent of alternative splicing; some indicate that alternative splicing is less widespread than in other model eukaryotes, whereas others suggest levels comparable to those of previously studied groups. In many cases, apicomplexan alternative splicing events appear not to generate multiple alternative proteins but instead produce aberrant or noncoding transcripts. Nonetheless, appropriate regulation of alternative splicing is clearly essential in  and  parasites, suggesting a biological role for at least some of the alternative splicing observed. Several studies have now disrupted conserved regulators of alternative splicing and demonstrated lethal effects in apicomplexans. This minireview discusses methods to accurately determine the extent of alternative splicing in Apicomplexa and discuss potential biological roles for this conserved process in a phylum of parasites with compact genomes."

            "#text": "is an opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Chronic  isolates generally do not express O antigen and often have a mucoid phenotype, which is characterized by the overproduction of the exopolysaccharide alginate. Therefore, O antigen expression and the mucoid phenotype may be coordinately regulated upon chronic adaption to the CF lung. Here we demonstrate that PDO300, a mucoid strain derived from the nonmucoid laboratory isolate PAO1, does not produce very long O antigen due to decreased expression of Wzz2, the very long O antigen chain length control protein, and that mucoid clinical isolates express reduced levels of Wzz2 compared to nonmucoid isolates. Further, we show that forcing the expression of very long O antigen by PDO300, by providing  in , does not alter alginate production, suggesting that sugar precursors are not limited between the two biosynthesis pathways. Moreover, we confirm that AmrZ, a transcription factor highly expressed in mucoid strains, is a negative regulator of  promoter activity and very long O antigen expression. These experiments identify the first transcriptional regulator of O antigen chain length in  and support a model where transition to a chronic mucoid phenotype is correlated with downregulation of very long O antigen through decreased Wzz2 production. Detection of mucoid , characterized by the overproduction of alginate, is correlated with the establishment of a chronic pulmonary infection and disease progression in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). In addition to the overproduction of alginate, loss of O antigen lipopolysaccharide production is also selected for in chronic infection isolates. In this study, we have identified the regulatory network that inversely regulates O antigen and alginate production. Understanding the regulation of these chronic phenotypes will elucidate mechanisms that are important for the establishment of a long-term  lung infection and ultimately provide an opportunity for intervention. Preventing  from chronically adapting to the CF lung environment could provide a better outcome for people who are infected."

Housekeeping NusG factors regulate expression of the bulk of the genome, whereas their highly specialized paralogs control just a few targets. In , NusG stimulates silencing of horizontally acquired genes, while its paralog RfaH counters NusG action by activating a subset of these genes. Acting alone or as part of regulatory complexes, NusG factors can promote uninterrupted RNA synthesis, bring about transcription pausing or premature termination, modulate RNA processing, and facilitate translation. Recent structural and mechanistic studies of NusG homologs from all domains of life reveal molecular details of multifaceted interactions that underpin their unexpectedly diverse regulatory roles. NusG proteins share conserved binding sites on RNA polymerase and many effects on the transcription elongation complex but differ in their mechanisms of recruitment, interactions with nucleic acids and secondary partners, and regulatory outcomes. Strikingly, some can alternate between autoinhibited and activated states that possess dramatically different secondary structures to achieve exquisite target specificity."

            "#text": "Tundra ecosystems are typically carbon (C) rich but nitrogen (N) limited. Since biological N fixation is the major source of biologically available N, the soil N-fixing (i.e., diazotrophic) community serves as an essential N supplier to the tundra ecosystem. Recent climate warming has induced deeper permafrost thaw and adversely affected C sequestration, which is modulated by N availability. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the responses of diazotrophic communities to warming across the depths of tundra soils. Herein, we carried out one of the deepest sequencing efforts of nitrogenase gene () to investigate how 5 years of experimental winter warming affects Alaskan soil diazotrophic community composition and abundance spanning both the organic and mineral layers. Although soil depth had a stronger influence on diazotrophic community composition than warming, warming significantly (0.05) enhanced diazotrophic abundance by 86.3% and aboveground plant biomass by 25.2%. Diazotrophic composition in the middle and lower organic layers, detected by  sequencing and a microarray-based tool (GeoChip), was markedly altered, with an increase of α-diversity. Changes in diazotrophic abundance and composition significantly correlated with soil moisture, soil thaw duration, and plant biomass, as shown by structural equation modeling analyses. Therefore, more abundant diazotrophic communities induced by warming may potentially serve as an important mechanism for supplementing biologically available N in this tundra ecosystem. With the likelihood that changes in global climate will adversely affect the soil C reservoir in the northern circumpolar permafrost zone, an understanding of the potential role of diazotrophic communities in enhancing biological N fixation, which constrains both plant production and microbial decomposition in tundra soils, is important in elucidating the responses of soil microbial communities to global climate change. A recent study showed that the composition of the diazotrophic community in a tundra soil exhibited no change under a short-term (1.5-year) winter warming experiment. However, it remains crucial to examine whether the lack of diazotrophic community responses to warming is persistent over a longer time period as a possibly important mechanism in stabilizing tundra soil C. Through a detailed characterization of the effects of winter warming on diazotrophic communities, we showed that a long-term (5-year) winter warming substantially enhanced diazotrophic abundance and altered community composition, though soil depth had a stronger influence on diazotrophic community composition than warming. These changes were best explained by changes in soil moisture, soil thaw duration, and plant biomass. These results provide crucial insights into the potential factors that may impact future C and N availability in tundra regions."

Many species contain more than one chemosensory system per genome, but little is known about their potential interplay. In this study, we reveal cross talk between two chemosensory pathways that modulate chemotaxis and biofilm formation in  We demonstrate that some chemoreceptors that govern chemotaxis also contribute to biofilm formation and these chemoreceptors can physically interact with components of both pathways. Finally, we show that the chemotaxis histidine kinase CheA can phosphorylate not only its cognate response regulator CheY but also one of the response regulators from the pathway mediating biofilm formation, FlmD. The phosphoryl group transfer from CheA to CheY is much faster than that from CheA to FlmD, which is consistent with chemotaxis being a fast response and biofilm formation being a much slower developmental process. We propose that cross talk between chemosensory pathways may play a role in coordination of complex behaviors in bacteria. In many bacteria, two or more homologous chemosensory pathways control several cellular functions, such as motility and gene regulation, in response to changes in the cell's microenvironment. Cross talk between signal transduction systems is poorly understood; while generally it is considered to be undesired, in some instances it might be beneficial for coregulation of complex behaviors. We demonstrate that several receptors from the pathway controlling motility can physically interact with downstream components of the pathway controlling biofilm formation. We further show that a kinase from the pathway controlling motility can also phosphorylate a response regulator from the pathway controlling biofilm formation. We propose that cross talk between two chemosensory pathways might be involved in coordination of two types of cell behavior-chemotaxis and biofilm formation."

            "#text": "Naturally occurring plasmids constitute a major category of mobile genetic elements responsible for harboring and transferring genes important in survival and fitness. A targeted evaluation of plasmidomes can reveal unique adaptations required by microbial communities. We developed a model system to optimize plasmid DNA isolation procedures targeted to groundwater samples which are typically characterized by low cell density (and likely variations in the plasmid size and copy numbers). The optimized method resulted in successful identification of several hundred circular plasmids, including some large plasmids (11 plasmids more than 50 kb in size, with the largest being 1.7 Mb in size). Several interesting observations were made from the analysis of plasmid DNA isolated in this study. The plasmid pool (plasmidome) was more conserved than the corresponding microbiome distribution (16S rRNA based). The circular plasmids were diverse as represented by the presence of seven plasmid incompatibility groups. The genes carried on these groundwater plasmids were highly enriched in metal resistance. Results from this study confirmed that traits such as metal, antibiotic, and phage resistance along with toxin-antitoxin systems are encoded on abundant circular plasmids, all of which could confer novel and advantageous traits to their hosts. This study confirms the ecological role of the plasmidome in maintaining the latent capacity of a microbiome, enabling rapid adaptation to environmental stresses. Plasmidomes have been typically studied in environments abundant in bacteria, and this is the first study to explore plasmids from an environment characterized by low cell density. We specifically target groundwater, a significant source of water for human/agriculture use. We used samples from a well-studied site and identified hundreds of circular plasmids, including one of the largest sizes reported in plasmidome studies. The striking similarity of the plasmid-borne ORFs in terms of taxonomical and functional classifications across several samples suggests a conserved plasmid pool, in contrast to the observed variability in the 16S rRNA-based microbiome distribution. Additionally, the stress response to environmental factors has stronger conservation via plasmid-borne genes as marked by abundance of metal resistance genes. Last, identification of novel and diverse plasmids enriches the existing plasmid database(s) and serves as a paradigm to increase the repertoire of biological parts that are available for modifying novel environmental strains."

            "#text": "Regulation of a variety of different cellular processes, including posttranslational modifications, is critical for the ability of many viruses to replicate efficiently within host cells. The adenovirus (Ad) E4-ORF3 protein assembles into polymers and forms a unique nuclear scaffold that leads to the relocalization and sequestration of cellular proteins, including small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs). Previously, we showed that E4-ORF3 functions as a SUMO E3 ligase of transcriptional intermediary factor-1 gamma (TIF-1γ) and promotes poly-SUMO chain formation. Here, we present cellular and biochemical data to further understand E4-ORF3 SUMO ligase activity. E4-ORF3 proteins from five different Ad species were found to possess SUMO E3 ligase activities  In infected cells, SUMO modifications of target proteins occurred only when the proteins were recruited into E4-ORF3 polymeric structures. By analyzing SUMO-deficient TIF-1γ, we demonstrated that SUMO conjugations are not required for E4-ORF3-mediated relocalization of target proteins in infected cells, implying that sequestration is followed by SUMO modification.  SUMO conjugation assays revealed the Ad E1B-55K oncoprotein as a new viral target of E4-ORF3-mediated SUMOylation. We also verified a direct function of E4-ORF3 as a SUMO ligase for multiple cellular proteins, including transcription factor II-I (TFII-I), Nbs1, and Mre11. Moreover, we discovered that E4-ORF3 associates with SUMO-bound UBC9, and E4-ORF3 polymerization is crucial for this ternary interaction. Together, our findings characterize E4-ORF3 as a novel polymer-type SUMO E3 ligase and provide mechanistic insights into the role of E4-ORF3 in SUMO conjugation. Viruses interplay with the host SUMOylation system to manipulate diverse cellular responses. The Ad E4-ORF3 protein forms a dynamic nuclear network to interfere with and exploit different host processes, including the DNA damage and interferon responses. We previously reported that E4-ORF3 is a SUMO E3 ligase. Here, we demonstrate that this activity is a conserved function of evolutionarily diverse human Ad E4-ORF3 proteins and that E4-ORF3 functions directly to promote SUMO conjugations to multiple cellular proteins. Recruitment of cellular substrates into E4-ORF3 nuclear inclusions is required for SUMO conjugation to occur  We probed the mechanism by which E4-ORF3 functions as a SUMO E3 ligase. Only multimeric, but not dimeric, E4-ORF3 binds to the SUMO E2 conjugation enzyme UBC9  only in a trimeric complex with SUMO. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which a conserved viral protein usurps the cellular SUMO conjugation machinery."

Many traditional mutation rate measurement assays are based on detecting mutations that cause resistance to a particular drug. Such assays typically work well for laboratory strains but have significant limitations when comparing clinical or environmental isolates that have various intrinsic levels of drug tolerance, which confounds the interpretation of results. Here we report the development and validation of a novel method of measuring mutation rates, which detects mutations that cause loss of fluorescence rather than acquisition of drug resistance. Using this method, we measured the mutation rates of clinical isolates of fungal pathogen  This assay can be adapted to other organisms and used to compare mutation rates in contexts where unequal drug sensitivity is anticipated."

            "#text": "The HIV-1 accessory protein Vif, which counteracts the antiviral action of the DNA-editing cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G), is an attractive and yet unexploited therapeutic target. Vif reduces the virion incorporation of A3G by targeting the restriction factor for proteasomal degradation in the virus-producing cell. Compounds that inhibit Vif-mediated degradation of A3G in cells targeted by HIV-1 would represent a novel antiviral therapeutic. We previously described small molecules with activity consistent with Vif antagonism. In this study, we derived inhibitor escape HIV-1 variants to characterize the mechanism by which these novel agents inhibit virus replication. Here we show that resistance to these agents is dependent on an amino acid substitution in Vif (V142I) and on a point mutation that likely upregulates transcription by modifying the lymphocyte enhancing factor 1 (LEF-1) binding site. Molecular modeling demonstrated a docking site in the Vif-Elongin C complex that is disrupted by these inhibitors. This docking site is lost when Vif acquires the V142I mutation that leads to inhibitor resistance. Competitive fitness experiments indicated that the V142I Vif and LEF-1 binding site mutations created a virus that is better adapted to growing in the presence of A3G than the wild-type virus. Although antiretroviral therapy can suppress HIV-1 replication effectively, virus reservoirs persist in infected individuals and virus replication rapidly rebounds if therapy is interrupted. Currently, there is a need for therapeutic approaches that eliminate, reduce, or control persistent viral reservoirs if a cure is to be realized. This work focuses on the preclinical development of novel, small-molecule inhibitors of the HIV-1 Vif protein. Vif inhibitors represent a new class of antiretroviral drugs that may expand treatment options to more effectively suppress virus replication or to drive HIV-1 reservoirs to a nonfunctional state by harnessing the activity of the DNA-editing cytidine deaminase A3G, a potent, intrinsic restriction factor expressed in macrophage and CD4 T cells. In this study, we derived inhibitor escape variants to characterize the mechanism by which these novel agents inhibit virus replication and to provide evidence for target validation."

        "Abstract": "Assembly of the division machinery in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria occurs in two time-dependent steps. First, the FtsZ proto-ring localizes at midcell including some FtsN molecules. Subsequently, the proteins that catalyze and regulate septal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis are recruited including among others, the FtsBLQ-PB1B-FtsW-PBP3 complex. Further accumulation of FtsN finally allows initiation of cell division. It was known that FtsA and FtsQLB somehow prevented this initiation. Recently, A. Boes, S. Olatunji, E. Breukink, and M. Terrak (mBio 10:e01912-18, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01912-18) reported that this is caused by inhibition of the activity of the PG synthases by FtsBLQ, which has to be outcompeted by accumulation of the PBP1b activating FtsN. This supports a central structural as well as regulatory role for the FtsBLQ protein complex that is conserved only in prokaryotes, making it an attractive target for antibiotic development.",

            "#text": "Gene duplication and subsequent evolutionary divergence have allowed conserved proteins to develop unique roles. The MarR family of transcription factors (TFs) has undergone extensive duplication and diversification in bacteria, where they act as environmentally responsive repressors of genes encoding efflux pumps that confer resistance to xenobiotics, including many antimicrobial agents. We have performed structural, functional, and genetic analyses of representative members of the SlyA/RovA lineage of MarR TFs, which retain some ancestral functions, including repression of their own expression and that of divergently transcribed multidrug efflux pumps, as well as allosteric inhibition by aromatic carboxylate compounds. However, SlyA and RovA have acquired the ability to countersilence horizontally acquired genes, which has greatly facilitated the evolution of  by horizontal gene transfer. SlyA/RovA TFs in different species have independently evolved novel regulatory circuits to provide the enhanced levels of expression required for their new role. Moreover, in contrast to MarR, SlyA is not responsive to copper. These observations demonstrate the ability of TFs to acquire new functions as a result of evolutionary divergence of both -regulatory sequences and in  interactions with modulatory ligands. Bacteria primarily evolve via horizontal gene transfer, acquiring new traits such as virulence and antibiotic resistance in single transfer events. However, newly acquired genes must be integrated into existing regulatory networks to allow appropriate expression in new hosts. This is accommodated in part by the opposing mechanisms of xenogeneic silencing and countersilencing. An understanding of these mechanisms is necessary to understand the relationship between gene regulation and bacterial evolution. Here we examine the functional evolution of an important lineage of countersilencers belonging to the ancient MarR family of classical transcriptional repressors. We show that although members of the SlyA lineage retain some ancestral features associated with the MarR family, their -regulatory sequences have evolved significantly to support their new function. Understanding the mechanistic requirements for countersilencing is critical to understanding the pathoadaptation of emerging pathogens and also has practical applications in synthetic biology."

            "#text": "Bacteria and fungi produce a wide array of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and these can act as chemical cues or as competitive tools. Recent work has shown that the VOC trimethylamine (TMA) can promote a new form of  growth, termed \"exploration.\" Here, we report that TMA also serves to alter nutrient availability in the area surrounding exploring cultures: TMA dramatically increases the environmental pH and, in doing so, reduces iron availability. This, in turn, compromises the growth of other soil bacteria and fungi. In response to this low-iron environment,  secretes a suite of differentially modified siderophores and upregulates genes associated with siderophore uptake. Further reducing iron levels by limiting siderophore uptake or growing cultures in the presence of iron chelators enhanced exploration. Exploration was also increased when  was grown in association with the related low-iron- and TMA-tolerant  bacteria, due to competition for available iron. We are only beginning to appreciate the role of VOCs in natural communities. This work reveals a new role for VOCs in modulating iron levels in the environment and implies a critical role for VOCs in modulating the behavior of microbes and the makeup of their communities. It further adds a new dimension to our understanding of the interspecies interactions that influence  exploration and highlights the importance of iron in exploration modulation. Microbial growth and community interactions are influenced by a multitude of factors. A new mode of  growth-exploration-is promoted by interactions with the yeast  and requires the emission of trimethylamine (TMA), a pH-raising volatile compound. We show here that TMA emission also profoundly alters the environment around exploring cultures. It specifically reduces iron availability, and this in turn adversely affects the viability of surrounding microbes. Paradoxically,  bacteria thrive in these iron-depleted niches, both rewiring their gene expression and metabolism to facilitate iron uptake and increasing their exploration rate. Growth in close proximity to other microbes adept at iron uptake also enhances exploration. Collectively, the data from this work reveal a new role for bacterial volatile compounds in modulating nutrient availability and microbial community behavior. The results further expand the repertoire of interspecies interactions and nutrient cues that impact  exploration and provide new mechanistic insight into this unique mode of bacterial growth."

The discovery of a murine papillomavirus (MmuPV1) provides the opportunity to study papillomavirus infections in a tractable,  laboratory model. MmuPV1 infects and causes disease in the cutaneous epithelium, as well as the mucosal epithelia of the oral cavity and anogenital tract. In this report, we describe a murine model of MmuPV1 infection and neoplastic disease in the female reproductive tracts of wild-type immunocompetent FVB mice. Low-grade dysplastic lesions developed in reproductive tracts of FVB mice infected with MmuPV1 for 4 months, and mice infected for 6 months developed significantly worse disease, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We also tested the contribution of estrogen and/or UV radiation (UVR), two cofactors we previously identified as being involved in papillomavirus-mediated disease, to cervicovaginal disease. Similar to HPV16 transgenic mice, exogenous estrogen treatment induced high-grade precancerous lesions in the reproductive tracts of MmuPV1-infected mice by 4 months and together with MmuPV1 efficiently induced SCC by 6 months. UV radiation and exogenous estrogen cooperated to promote carcinogenesis in MmuPV1-infected mice. This murine infection model represents the first instance of  papillomavirus-mediated carcinogenesis in the female reproductive tract of wild-type mice resulting from active virus infection and is also the first report of the female hormone estrogen contributing to this process. This model will provide an additional platform for fundamental studies on papillomavirus infection, cervicovaginal disease, and the role of cellular cofactors during papillomavirus-induced carcinogenesis. Tractable and efficient models of papillomavirus-induced pathogenesis are limited due to the strict species-specific and tissue-specific tropism of these viruses. Here, we report a novel preclinical murine model of papillomavirus-induced cervicovaginal disease in wild-type, immunocompetent mice using the recently discovered murine papillomavirus, MmuPV1. In this model, MmuPV1 establishes persistent viral infections in the mucosal epithelia of the female reproductive tract, a necessary component needed to accurately mimic HPV-mediated neoplastic disease in humans. Persistent MmuPV1 infections were able to induce progressive neoplastic disease and carcinogenesis, either alone or in combination with previously identified cofactors of papillomavirus-induced disease. This new model will provide a much-needed platform for basic and translational studies on both papillomavirus infection and associated disease in immunocompetent mice."

There is also variation in the intrinsic resistance levels of different bacterial strains and species that is not associated with any known history of exposure. In many cases, evolved resistance is costly to the bacteria, such that resistant types have lower fitness than their progenitors in the absence of antibiotics. Some longer-term studies have shown that bacteria often evolve compensatory changes that overcome these tradeoffs, but even those studies have typically lasted only a few hundred generations. In this study, we examine changes in the susceptibilities of 12 populations of  to 15 antibiotics after 2,000 and 50,000 generations without exposure to any antibiotic. On average, the evolved bacteria were more susceptible to most antibiotics than was their ancestor. The bacteria at 50,000 generations tended to be even more susceptible than after 2,000 generations, although most of the change occurred during the first 2,000 generations. Despite the general trend toward increased susceptibility, we saw diverse outcomes with different antibiotics. For streptomycin, which was the only drug to which the ancestral strain was highly resistant, none of the evolved lines showed any increased susceptibility. The independently evolved lineages often exhibited correlated responses to the antibiotics, with correlations usually corresponding to their modes of action. On balance, our study shows that bacteria with low levels of intrinsic resistance often evolve to become even more susceptible to antibiotics in the absence of corresponding selection. Resistance to antibiotics often evolves when bacteria encounter antibiotics. However, bacterial strains and species without any known exposure to these drugs also vary in their intrinsic susceptibility. In many cases, evolved resistance has been shown to be costly to the bacteria, such that resistant types have reduced competitiveness relative to their sensitive progenitors in the absence of antibiotics. In this study, we examined changes in the susceptibilities of 12 populations of  to 15 antibiotics after 2,000 and 50,000 generations without exposure to any drug. The evolved bacteria tended to become more susceptible to most antibiotics, with most of the change occurring during the first 2,000 generations, when the bacteria were undergoing rapid adaptation to their experimental conditions. On balance, our findings indicate that bacteria with low levels of intrinsic resistance can, in the absence of relevant selection, become even more susceptible to antibiotics."

            "#text": "Viral infection exerts selection pressure on marine microbes, as virus-induced cell lysis causes 20 to 50% of cell mortality, resulting in fluxes of biomass into oceanic dissolved organic matter. Archaeal and bacterial populations can defend against viral infection using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) system, which relies on specific matching between a spacer sequence and a viral gene. If a CRISPR spacer match to any gene within a viral genome is equally effective in preventing lysis, no viral genes should be preferentially matched by CRISPR spacers. However, if there are differences in effectiveness, certain viral genes may demonstrate a greater frequency of CRISPR spacer matches. Indeed, homology search analyses of bacterioplankton CRISPR spacer sequences against virioplankton sequences revealed preferential matching of replication proteins, nucleic acid binding proteins, and viral structural proteins. Positive selection pressure for effective viral defense is one parsimonious explanation for these observations. CRISPR spacers from virioplankton metagenomes preferentially matched methyltransferase and phage integrase genes within virioplankton sequences. These virioplankton CRISPR spacers may assist infected host cells in defending against competing phage. Analyses also revealed that half of the spacer-matched viral genes were unknown, some genes matched several spacers, and some spacers matched multiple genes, a many-to-many relationship. Thus, CRISPR spacer matching may be an evolutionary algorithm, agnostically identifying those genes under stringent selection pressure for sustaining viral infection and lysis. Investigating this subset of viral genes could reveal those genetic mechanisms essential to virus-host interactions and provide new technologies for optimizing CRISPR defense in beneficial microbes. The CRISPR-Cas system is one means by which bacterial and archaeal populations defend against viral infection which causes 20 to 50% of cell mortality in the ocean. We tested the hypothesis that certain viral genes are preferentially targeted for the initial attack of the CRISPR-Cas system on a viral genome. Using CASC, a pipeline for CRISPR spacer discovery, and metagenome data from oceanic microbes and viruses, we found a clear subset of viral genes with high match frequencies to CRISPR spacers. Moreover, we observed a many-to-many relationship of spacers and viral genes. These high-match viral genes were involved in nucleotide metabolism, DNA methylation, and viral structure. It is possible that CRISPR spacer matching is an evolutionary algorithm pointing to those viral genes most important to sustaining infection and lysis. Studying these genes may advance the understanding of virus-host interactions in nature and provide new technologies for leveraging CRISPR-Cas systems in beneficial microbes."

Both small molecules and proteins shuttle high-energy, low-potential electrons liberated during catabolism through diverse metabolic landscapes. Ferredoxin (Fd) proteins-an abundant class of Fe-S-containing small proteins-are essential in many species for energy conservation and ATP production strategies. It remains difficult to model electron flow through complicated metabolisms and in systems in which multiple Fd proteins are present. The overlap of activity and/or limitations of electron flux through each Fd can limit physiology and metabolic engineering strategies. Here we establish the interplay, reactivity, and physiological role(s) of the three ferredoxin proteins in the model hyperthermophile  We demonstrate that the three loci encoding known Fds are subject to distinct regulatory mechanisms and that specific Fds are utilized to shuttle electrons to separate respiratory and energy production complexes during different physiological states. The results obtained argue that unique physiological roles have been established for each Fd and that continued use of  and related hydrogen-evolving species as bioengineering platforms must account for the distinct Fd partnerships that limit flux to desired electron acceptors. Extrapolating our results more broadly, the retention of multiple Fd isoforms in most species argues that specialized Fd partnerships are likely to influence electron flux throughout biology. High-energy electrons liberated during catabolic processes can be exploited for energy-conserving mechanisms. Maximal energy gains demand these valuable electrons be accurately shuttled from electron donor to appropriate electron acceptor. Proteinaceous electron carriers such as ferredoxins offer opportunities to exploit specific ferredoxin partnerships to ensure that electron flux to critical physiological pathways is aligned with maximal energy gains. Most species encode many ferredoxin isoforms, but very little is known about the role of individual ferredoxins in most systems. Our results detail that ferredoxin isoforms make largely unique and distinct protein interactions  and that flux through one ferredoxin often cannot be recovered by flux through a different ferredoxin isoform. The results obtained more broadly suggest that ferredoxin isoforms throughout biological life have evolved not as generic electron shuttles, but rather serve as selective couriers of valuable low-potential electrons from select electron donors to desirable electron acceptors."

Despite the importance of these molecules, the total number of small proteins remains unknown because conventional annotation pipelines usually exclude small open reading frames (smORFs). We previously identified several dozen small proteins in the model organism  using theoretical bioinformatic approaches based on sequence conservation and matches to canonical ribosome binding sites. Here, we present an empirical approach for discovering new proteins, taking advantage of recent advances in ribosome profiling in which antibiotics are used to trap newly initiated 70S ribosomes at start codons. This approach led to the identification of many novel initiation sites in intergenic regions in  We tagged 41 smORFs on the chromosome and detected protein synthesis for all but three. Not only are the corresponding genes intergenic but they are also found antisense to other genes, in operons, and overlapping other open reading frames (ORFs), some impacting the translation of larger downstream genes. These results demonstrate the utility of this method for identifying new genes, regardless of their genomic context. Proteins comprised of 50 or fewer amino acids have been shown to interact with and modulate the functions of larger proteins in a range of organisms. Despite the possible importance of small proteins, the true prevalence and capabilities of these regulators remain unknown as the small size of the proteins places serious limitations on their identification, purification, and characterization. Here, we present a ribosome profiling approach with stalled initiation complexes that led to the identification of 38 new small proteins."

The genetic, genomic, and biochemical tools available for dissection of THOR provide the means to achieve a new level of understanding of microbial community behavior. The manipulation and engineering of microbiomes could lead to improved human health, environmental sustainability, and agricultural productivity. However, microbiomes have proven difficult to alter in predictable ways, and their emergent properties are poorly understood. The history of biology has demonstrated the power of model systems to understand complex problems such as gene expression or development. Therefore, a defined and genetically tractable model community would be useful to dissect microbiome assembly, maintenance, and processes. We have developed a tractable model rhizosphere microbiome, designated THOR, containing , , and , which represent three dominant phyla in the rhizosphere, as well as in soil and the mammalian gut. The model community demonstrates emergent properties, and the members are amenable to genetic dissection. We propose that THOR will be a useful model for investigations of community-level interactions."

Several factors have been identified that influence the production of the two major  toxins, TcdA and TcdB, but prior published evidence suggested that additional unknown factors were involved in toxin regulation. Previously, we identified a  regulator, RstA, that promotes sporulation and represses motility and toxin production. We observed that the predicted DNA-binding domain of RstA was required for RstA-dependent repression of toxin genes, motility genes, and  transcription. In this study, we further investigated the regulation of toxin and motility gene expression by RstA. DNA pulldown assays confirmed that RstA directly binds the  promoter via the predicted DNA-binding domain. Through mutational analysis of the  promoter, we identified several nucleotides that are important for RstA-dependent transcriptional regulation. Further, we observed that RstA directly binds and regulates the promoters of the toxin genes  and , as well as the promoters for the  and  genes, which encode regulators of toxin gene expression. Complementation analyses with the  RstA ortholog and a multispecies chimeric RstA protein revealed that the  C-terminal domain is required for RstA DNA-binding activity, suggesting that species-specific signaling controls RstA function. Our data demonstrate that RstA is a transcriptional repressor that autoregulates its own expression and directly inhibits transcription of the two toxin genes and two positive toxin regulators, thereby acting at multiple regulatory points to control toxin production. is an anaerobic, gastrointestinal pathogen of humans and other mammals.  produces two major toxins, TcdA and TcdB, which cause the symptoms of the disease, and forms dormant endospores to survive the aerobic environment outside the host. A recently discovered regulatory factor, RstA, inhibits toxin production and positively influences spore formation. Herein, we determine that RstA directly binds its own promoter DNA to repress its own gene transcription. In addition, our data demonstrate that RstA directly represses toxin gene expression and gene expression of two toxin gene activators, TcdR and SigD, creating a complex regulatory network to tightly control toxin production. This study provides a novel regulatory link between  sporulation and toxin production. Further, our data suggest that  toxin production is regulated through a direct, species-specific sensing mechanism."

            "#text": "The , a lineage of cytochrome-containing methanogens, have recently been proposed to participate in direct extracellular electron transfer interactions within syntrophic communities. To shed light on this phenomenon, we applied electrochemical techniques to measure electron uptake from cathodes by , which is an important model organism that is genetically tractable and utilizes a wide range of substrates for methanogenesis. Here, we confirm the ability of  to perform electron uptake from cathodes and show that this cathodic current is linked to quantitative increases in methane production. The underlying mechanisms we identified include, but are not limited to, a recently proposed association between cathodes and methanogen-derived extracellular enzymes (e.g., hydrogenases) that can facilitate current generation through the formation of reduced and diffusible methanogenic substrates (e.g., hydrogen). However, after minimizing the contributions of such extracellular enzymes and using a mutant lacking hydrogenases, we observe a lower-potential hydrogen-independent pathway that facilitates cathodic activity coupled to methane production in  Our electrochemical measurements of wild-type and mutant strains point to a novel and hydrogenase-free mode of electron uptake with a potential near -484 mV versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) (over 100 mV more reduced than the observed hydrogenase midpoint potential under these conditions). These results suggest that  can perform multiple modes (hydrogenase-mediated and free extracellular enzyme-independent modes) of electrode interactions on cathodes, including a mechanism pointing to a direct interaction, which has significant applied and ecological implications. Methanogenic archaea are of fundamental applied and environmental relevance. This is largely due to their activities in a wide range of anaerobic environments, generating gaseous reduced carbon that can be utilized as a fuel source. While the bioenergetics of a wide variety of methanogens have been well studied with respect to soluble substrates, a mechanistic understanding of their interaction with solid-phase redox-active compounds is limited. This work provides insight into solid-phase redox interactions in  spp. using electrochemical methods. We highlight a previously undescribed mode of electron uptake from cathodes that is potentially informative of direct interspecies electron transfer interactions in the ."

The most common azole resistance allele currently described is a linked change corresponding to a change in the coding sequence of  and a duplication of a 34-bp region in the promoter leading to a tandem repeat (TR).

Close to 900 genes were found to have an AtrR response element (ATRE) in their promoter regions. Transcriptome evaluation by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) indicated that both alleles led to elevated transcription of a subset of target genes. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I protection mapping localized the ATREs in both the  and  promoters. The ATRE in  was located within the 34-bp repeat element.

Given the success of many invasions, this is sometimes called the genetic paradox of invasion.  is invasive, limited to asexual reproduction within four lineages, and presumed clonal. It is responsible for sudden oak death in the United States, sudden larch death in Europe, and ramorum blight in North America and Europe. We sequenced the genomes of 107 isolates to determine how this pathogen can overcome the invasion paradox. Mitotic recombination (MR) associated with transposons and low gene density has generated runs of homozygosity (ROH) affecting 2,698 genes, resulting in novel genotypic diversity within the lineages. One ROH enriched in effectors was fixed in the NA1 lineage. An independent ROH affected the same scaffold in the EU1 lineage, suggesting an MR hot spot and a selection target. Differences in host infection between EU1 isolates with and without the ROH suggest that they may differ in aggressiveness. Non-core regions (not shared by all lineages) had signatures of accelerated evolution and were enriched in putative pathogenicity genes and transposons. There was a striking pattern of gene loss, including all effectors, in the non-core EU2 genome. Positive selection was observed in 8.0% of RxLR and 18.8% of Crinkler effector genes compared with 0.9% of the core eukaryotic gene set. We conclude that the  lineages are diverging via a rapidly evolving non-core genome and that the invasive asexual lineages are not clonal, but display genotypic diversity caused by MR. Alien species are often successful invaders in new environments, despite the introduction of a few isolates with a reduced genetic pool. This is called the genetic paradox of invasion. We found two mechanisms by which the invasive forest pathogen causing sudden oak and sudden larch death can evolve. Extensive mitotic recombination producing runs of homozygosity generates genotypic diversity even in the absence of sexual reproduction, and rapid turnover of genes in the non-core, or nonessential portion of genome not shared by all isolates, allows pathogenicity genes to evolve rapidly or be eliminated while retaining essential genes. Mitotic recombination events occur in genomic hot spots, resulting in similar ROH patterns in different isolates or groups; one ROH, independently generated in two different groups, was enriched in pathogenicity genes and may be a target for selection. This provides important insights into the evolution of invasive alien pathogens and their potential for adaptation and future persistence."

Magnetotaxis relies on the formation and proper inheritance of these unique magnetic organelles, both of which need to be coordinated with the segregation of other cellular content such as chromosomes or motility and chemotaxis related structures. Thus, elaborated mechanisms are required in MTB to coordinate and maintain a high level of spatial and temporal subcellular organization during cytokinesis. However, thus far, underlying mechanisms and polarity determinants such as landmark proteins remained obscure in MTB. Here, we analyzed an ortholog of the olar rganizing rotein  in the alphaproteobacterium  termed PopZ  We show that deletion of the  gene causes abnormal cell elongation, minicell formation, DNA missegregation, and impairs motility. Overproduction of PopZ  results in PopZ-rich regions near the poles, which are devoid of larger macromolecules, such as ribosomes, chromosomal DNA, and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules. Using superresolution microscopy, we show that PopZ  exhibits a bipolar localization pattern throughout the cell cycle, indicating that the definition of new poles in  occurs immediately upon completion of cytokinesis. Moreover, substitution of PopZ orthologs between  and the related alphaproteobacterium  indicated that PopZ localization depends on host-specific cues and that both orthologs have diverged to an extent that allows only partial reciprocal functional complementation. Altogether, our results indicate that in , PopZ plays a critical role during cell division and segregation of cellular content. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) share the unique capability of magnetic navigation, one of the most complex behavioral responses found in prokaryotes, by means of magnetosomes, which act as an internal compass. Due to formation of these unique nanoparticles, MTB have emerged as a model to study prokaryotic organelle formation and cytoskeletal organization in conjunction with complex motility systems. Despite the high degree of subcellular organization required in MTB, less is known about cell-cycle-related factors or proteins responsible for spatiotemporal polarity control. Here, we investigate the function of the polar organizer PopZ in the magnetotactic alphaproteobacterium  Although PopZ is widely distributed among the alphaproteobacteria, its function in MTB belonging to this class has remained unexplored. Our results suggest that in , PopZ has a key role during cell division and subcellular organization. Furthermore, we show that PopZ localization and function differ from other nonmagnetotactic alphaproteobacterial model organisms."

Antibiotic-mediated destruction of the microbiota leads to expansion of CR in the gut, markedly increasing the risk of bacteremia in vulnerable patients. While preventing dense colonization represents a rational approach to reduce intra- and interpatient dissemination of CR, little is known about pathogen-associated factors that enable dense growth and persistence in the intestinal lumen. To identify genetic factors essential for dense colonization of the gut by CR, we constructed a highly saturated transposon mutant library with >150,000 unique mutations in an ST258 strain of CR and screened for  growth and  intestinal colonization in antibiotic-treated mice. Stochastic and partially reversible fluctuations in the representation of different mutations during dense colonization revealed the dynamic nature of intestinal microbial populations. We identified genes that are crucial for early and late stages of dense gut colonization and confirmed their role by testing isogenic mutants in  competition assays with wild-type CR- Screening of the transposon library also identified mutations that enhanced  CR growth. These newly identified colonization factors may provide novel therapeutic opportunities to reduce intestinal colonization by CR- is a common cause of bloodstream infections in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients, and over the last 2 decades, some strains have acquired resistance to nearly all available antibiotics, including broad-spectrum carbapenems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has listed carbapenem-resistant  (CR) as an urgent public health threat. Dense colonization of the intestine by CR and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria is associated with an increased risk of bacteremia. Reducing the density of gut colonization by CR is likely to reduce their transmission from patient to patient in health care facilities as well as systemic infections. How CR expands and persists in the gut lumen, however, is poorly understood. Herein, we generated a highly saturated mutant library in a multidrug-resistant  strain and identified genetic factors that are associated with dense gut colonization by  This study sheds light on host colonization by  and identifies potential colonization factors that contribute to high-density persistence of  in the intestine."

Whether the manipulation of the gut microbiota can be used as a strategy to improve CTX-induced mucositis remains to be studied. Here we observed the effects of a 4-week calorie restriction (CR) on CTX-induced mucositis. Compared with -fed mice, CR mice showed significantly less mucositis in response to CTX, including lower intestinal permeability, less bacterial translocation, higher number of epithelial stem cells, and less epithelium damage. CTX induced significant shifts of the gut microbiota of the gut microbiota in -fed control mice. In contrast, CR mice showed no significant change in their gut microbiota in responding to CTX treatment. CR significantly enriched the gut microbiota in  and  which are known to mitigate inflammation and improve gut barrier function. These findings suggest that CR remodeled gut microbiota is more robust and may contribute to attenuate the side effects of cyclophosphamide, which supports the concept that cancer chemotherapy would benefit from strategies targeting the gut microbiota. Improving the gut microbiota via calorie restriction is beneficial for human health. Our findings showed differential responses between calorie-restricted mice and -fed mice. Compared with the -fed mice, the calorie-restricted mice were less susceptible to cyclophosphamide side effects otherwise observed on the gut integrity and its microbiota. These results show the potential benefits of manipulating the gut microbiota with CR prior to cancer chemotherapy."

            "#text": "HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) plays critical roles in both early and late stages of the viral replication cycle. Mutagenesis and structural experiments have revealed that capsid core stability significantly affects uncoating and initiation of reverse transcription in host cells. This has led to efforts in developing antivirals targeting CA and its assembly, although none of the currently identified compounds are used in the clinic for treatment of HIV infection. A specific interaction that is primarily present in pentameric interfaces in the HIV-1 capsid core was identified and is reported to be important for CA assembly. This is shown by multidisciplinary characterization of CA site-directed mutants using biochemical analysis of virus-like particle formation, transmission electron microscopy of  assembly, crystallographic studies, and molecular dynamic simulations. The data are consistent with a model where a hydrogen bond between CA residues E28 and K30' from neighboring N-terminal domains (CAs) is important for CA pentamer interactions during core assembly. This pentamer-preferred interaction forms part of an -terminal omain nterface (NDI) pocket that is amenable to antiviral targeting. Precise assembly and disassembly of the HIV-1 capsid core are key to the success of viral replication. The forces that govern capsid core formation and dissociation involve intricate interactions between pentamers and hexamers formed by HIV-1 CA. We identified one particular interaction between E28 of one CA and K30' of the adjacent CA that appears more frequently in pentamers than in hexamers and that is important for capsid assembly. Targeting the corresponding site could lead to the development of antivirals which disrupt this interaction and affect capsid assembly."

            "#text": "uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to invade host plants. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a two-component system (TCS), RhpRS, enables  to coordinate the T3SS gene expression, which depends on the phosphorylation state of RhpR under different environmental conditions. Orthologues of RhpRS are distributed in a wide range of bacterial species, indicating a general regulatory mechanism. How RhpRS uses external signals and the phosphorylation state to exercise its regulatory functions remains unknown. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) assays to identify the specific binding sites of RhpR and RhpR in either King's B medium (KB [a T3SS-inhibiting medium]) or minimal medium (MM [a T3SS-inducing medium]). We identified 125 KB-dependent binding sites and 188 phosphorylation-dependent binding sites of RhpR. In KB, RhpR directly and positively regulated cytochrome  production (via ) and alcohol dehydrogenase activity (via ) but negatively regulated anthranilate synthase activity (via ) and protease activity (via ). In addition, phosphorylated RhpR (RhpR-P) directly and negatively regulated the T3SS (via  and ), swimming motility (via ), c-di-GMP levels (via PSPPH_2590), and biofilm formation (via ). It positively regulated twitching motility (via ) and lipopolysaccharide production (via PSPPH_2653). Our transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses identified 474 and 840 new genes that were regulated by RhpR in KB and MM, respectively. We showed nutrient-rich conditions allowed RhpR to directly regulate multiple metabolic pathways of  and phosphorylation enabled RhpR to specifically control virulence and the cell envelope. The action of RhpRS switched between virulence and regulation of multiple metabolic pathways by tuning its phosphorylation and sensing environmental signals in KB, respectively. The plant pathogen  invades host plants through a type III secretion system, which is strictly regulated by a two-component system called RhpRS. The orthologues of RhpRS are widely distributed in the bacterial kingdom. The master regulator RhpR specifically depends on the phosphorylation state to regulate the majority of the virulence-related genes. Under nutrient-rich conditions, it modulates many important metabolic pathways, which consist of one-fifth of the genome. We propose that RhpRS uses phosphorylation- and nutrition-dependent mechanisms to switch between regulating virulence and metabolism, and this functionality is widely conserved among bacterial species."

Urogenital strains are responsible for a self-limited conjunctivitis and the sequelae of infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhagic proctitis. However, the differential cellular responses that drive these clinically observed disease outcomes are not completely understood. Primary conjunctival, endocervical, and endometrial epithelial and stromal fibroblast cells, HeLa229 cells, and immortalized conjunctival epithelial (HCjE) cells were infected with the ocular A/Har-13 (A) and Ba/Apache-2 (Ba) strains and urogenital D/UW-3 (D) and E/Bour (E) strains. Infection rates, progeny production, and cytokine/chemokine secretion levels were evaluated in comparison with those in uninfected cells. All strain types infected all cell types with similar levels of efficacy and development. However, progeny production levels differed among primary cells: Ba produced significantly more progeny than E in endocervical and endometrial fibroblasts, while A progeny were less abundant than E progeny.  infection of primary epithelial cells elicited an increase in pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators compared to levels in uninfected cells, but there were no significant differences by strain type. In contrast, for primary fibroblasts, ocular strains elicited significant increases in the pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β, thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12p70, and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) compared to levels in urogenital strains, while urogenital strains elicited a distinct and significant increase in the proinflammatory mediators IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Our data indicate that primary fibroblasts, not epithelial cells, drive host inflammatory responses that are dependent on strain type and likely influence disease outcomes, establishing their importance as a novel model for studies of  disease pathogenesis. is a human pathogen and the leading cause of preventable blindness and sexually transmitted diseases in the world. Certain  strains cause ocular disease, while others cause upper genital tract pathology. However, little is known about the cellular or immunologic basis for these differences. Here, we compared the abilities of the strain types to infect, replicate, and initiate an immune response in primary human ocular and urogenital epithelial cells, as well as in fibroblasts from the underlying stroma. While there were no significant differences in infection rates or intracellular growth for any strain in any cell type, proinflammatory responses were driven not by the epithelial cells but by fibroblasts and were distinct between ocular and urogenital strains. Our findings suggest that primary fibroblasts are a novel and more appropriate model for studies of immune responses that will expand our understanding of the differential pathological disease outcomes caused by various  strain types."

            "#text": "In many regions of the world oceans, phytoplankton face the problem of discriminating between phosphate, an essential nutrient, and arsenate, a toxic analogue. Many phytoplankton, including the most abundant phytoplankton group known, , detoxify arsenate (AsV) by reduction to arsenite (AsIII), followed by methylation and excretion of the methylated arsenic products. We synthesized [C]dimethyl arsenate (DMA) and used it to show that cultured  strain HTCC7211 (SAR11) cells oxidize the methyl group carbons of DMA, producing CO and ATP. We measured [C]DMA oxidation rates in the P-depleted surface waters of the Sargasso Sea, a subtropical ocean gyre. [C]DMA was oxidized to CO by Sargasso Sea plankton communities at a rate that would cause turnover of the estimated DMA standing stock every 8.1 days. SAR11 strain HTCC7211, which was isolated from the Sargasso Sea, has a pair of arsenate resistance genes and was resistant to arsenate, showing no growth inhibition at As/P ratios of >65:1. Across the global oceans, there was a strong inverse relationship between the frequency of the arsenate reductase (LMWPc_ArsC) in  genomes and phosphate concentrations. We propose that the demethylation of methylated arsenic compounds by  and possibly other bacterioplankton, coupled with arsenate resistance, results in the transfer of energy from phytoplankton to bacteria. We dub this a parasitic cycle because the release of arsenate by  in principle creates a positive-feedback loop that forces phytoplankton to continually regenerate arsenate detoxification products, producing a flow of energy to P-limited ocean regions. In vast, warm regions of the oceans, phytoplankton face the problem of arsenic poisoning. Arsenate is toxic because it is chemically similar to phosphate, a scarce nutrient that phytoplankton cells need for growth. Many phytoplankton, including the commonest phytoplankton type in warm oceans, , detoxify arsenate by adding methyl groups. Here we show that the most abundant non-photosynthetic plankton in the oceans, SAR11 bacteria, remove the methyl groups, releasing poisonous forms of arsenic back into the water. We postulate that the methylation and demethylation of arsenic compounds creates a cycle in which the phytoplankton can never get ahead and must continually transfer energy to the SAR11 bacteria. We dub this a parasitic process and suggest that it might help explain why SAR11 bacteria are so successful, surpassing all other plankton in their numbers. Field experiments were done in the Sargasso Sea, a subtropical ocean gyre that is sometimes called an ocean desert because, throughout much of the year, there is not enough phosphorous in the water to support large blooms of phytoplankton. Ocean deserts are expanding as the oceans absorb heat and grow warmer."

            "#text": "Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are double-stranded DNA viruses causative in a host of human diseases, including several cancers. Following infection, two viral proteins, E1 and E2, activate viral replication in association with cellular factors and stimulate the DNA damage response (DDR) during the replication process. E1-E2 uses homologous recombination (HR) to facilitate DNA replication, but an understanding of host factors involved in this process remains incomplete. Previously, we demonstrated that the class III deacetylase SIRT1, which can regulate HR, is recruited to E1-E2-replicating DNA and regulates the level of replication. Here, we demonstrate that SIRT1 promotes the fidelity of E1-E2 replication and that the absence of SIRT1 results in reduced recruitment of the DNA repair protein Werner helicase (WRN) to E1-E2-replicating DNA. CRISPR/Cas9 editing demonstrates that WRN, like SIRT1, regulates the quantity and fidelity of E1-E2 replication. This is the first report of WRN regulation of E1-E2 DNA replication, or a role for WRN in the HPV life cycle. In the absence of SIRT1 there is an increased acetylation and stability of WRN, but a reduced ability to interact with E1-E2-replicating DNA. We present a model in which E1-E2 replication turns on the DDR, stimulating SIRT1 deacetylation of WRN. This deacetylation promotes WRN interaction with E1-E2-replicating DNA to control the quantity and fidelity of replication. As well as offering a crucial insight into HPV replication control, this system offers a unique model for investigating the link between SIRT1 and WRN in controlling replication in mammalian cells. HPV16 is the major viral human carcinogen responsible for between 3 and 4% of all cancers worldwide. Following infection, this virus activates the DNA damage response (DDR) to promote its life cycle and recruits DDR proteins to its replicating DNA in order to facilitate homologous recombination during replication. This promotes the production of viable viral progeny. Our understanding of how HPV16 replication interacts with the DDR remains incomplete. Here, we demonstrate that the cellular deacetylase SIRT1, which is a part of the E1-E2 replication complex, regulates recruitment of the DNA repair protein WRN to the replicating DNA. We demonstrate that WRN regulates the level and fidelity of E1-E2 replication. Overall, the results suggest a mechanism by which SIRT1 deacetylation of WRN promotes its interaction with E1-E2-replicating DNA to control the levels and fidelity of that replication."

FliL, a component protein of the flagellar motor, is known to enhance the motor performance under high-load conditions in some bacteria. Here we determined the structure of the periplasmic region of FliL (FliL) of the polar flagellum of  FliL shows a remarkable structural similarity to the stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflK/C (SPFH) domain of stomatin family proteins, some of which are involved in modulation of ion channel activities in various organisms. FliL forms a ring assembly in the crystal with an inner diameter of around 8 nm, which is comparable to the size of the stator unit. Mutational analyses suggest that the FliL ring forms a complex with the stator unit and that the length of the periplasmic linkers of FliL and the stator B-subunit is essential for the complex formation. We propose a model of the FliL-stator complex to discuss how  FliL modulates stator function in the bacterial flagellar motor under conditions of high viscosity. Some flagellated bacteria regulate motor torque in response to the external load change. This behavior is critical for survival, but the mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we focused on a key protein, FliL of , and solved the crystal structure of its periplasmic region (FliL). FliL reveals striking structural similarity to a conserved domain of stomatin, which is involved in ion channel regulation in some organisms, including mammals. FliL forms a ring with an inner diameter that is comparable in size to the stator unit. The mutational analyses suggested that the presence of the ring-like assembly of FliL around the stator unit enhances the surface swarming of  cells. Our study data also imply that the structural element for the ion channel regulation is conserved from bacteria to mammals."

            "#text": "Many flagellated bacteria \"swarm\" over a solid surface as a dense consortium. In different bacteria, swarming is facilitated by several alterations such as those corresponding to increased flagellum numbers, special stator proteins, or secreted surfactants. We report here a change in the chemosensory physiology of swarming  which alters its normal \"run tumble\" bias.  bacteria taken from a swarm exhibit more highly extended runs (low tumble bias) and higher speeds than  bacteria swimming individually in a liquid medium. The stability of the signaling protein CheZ is higher in swarmers, consistent with the observed elevation of CheZ levels and with the low tumble bias. We show that the tumble bias displayed by wild-type swarmers is the optimal bias for maximizing swarm expansion. In assays performed in liquid, swarm cells have reduced chemotactic performance. This behavior is specific to swarming, is not specific to growth on surfaces, and persists for a generation. Therefore, the chemotaxis signaling pathway is reprogrammed for swarming. The fundamental motile behavior of  is a random walk, where straight \"runs\" are punctuated by \"tumbles.\" This behavior, conferred by the chemotaxis signaling system, is used to track chemical gradients in liquid. Our study results show that when migrating collectively on surfaces,  modifies its chemosensory physiology to decrease its tumble bias (and hence to increase run durations) by post-transcriptional changes that alter the levels of a key signaling protein. We speculate that the low tumble bias may contribute to the observed Lévy walk (LW) trajectories within the swarm, where run durations have a power law distribution. In animals, LW patterns are hypothesized to maximize searches in unpredictable environments. Swarming bacteria face several challenges while moving collectively over a surface-maintaining cohesion, overcoming constraints imposed by a physical substrate, searching for nutrients as a group, and surviving lethal levels of antimicrobials. The altered chemosensory behavior that we describe in this report may help with these challenges."

HPV genomes replicate in infected cells via bidirectional theta replication and a poorly understood unidirectional mechanism. In this report, we provide evidence that the previously described interaction between the viral E1 helicase and the cellular UAF1-USP1 deubiquitinating enzyme complex, a member of the Fanconi anemia DNA damage response pathway, is required for the completion of the bidirectional theta replication of the HPV11 genome and the subsequent initiation of the unidirectional replication. We show that unidirectional replication proceeds via theta structures and is supported by the cellular Bloom helicase, which interacts directly with E1 and whose engagement in HPV11 replication requires UAF1-USP1 activity. We propose that the unidirectional replication of the HPV11 genome initiates from replication fork restart events. These findings suggest a new role for the Fanconi anemia pathway in HPV replication. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are important pathogens that replicate their double-stranded circular DNA genome in the nucleus of infected cells. HPV genomes replicate in infected cells via bidirectional theta replication and a poorly understood unidirectional mechanism, and the onset of viral replication requires the engagement of cellular DNA damage response pathways. In this study, we showed that the previously described interaction between the viral E1 helicase and the cellular UAF1-USP1 complex is necessary for the completion of bidirectional replication and the subsequent initiation of the unidirectional replication mechanism. Our results suggest HPVs may use the cellular Fanconi anemia DNA damage pathway to achieve the separation of daughter molecules generated by bidirectional theta replication. Additionally, our results indicate that the unidirectional replication of the HPV genome is initiated from restarted bidirectional theta replication forks."

The  genome contains four genes coding for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are important regulatory knots involved in diverse cellular responses. From a clinical perspective, MAPK activity has been connected to salvage pathways, which can determine the failure of effective treatment of invasive mycoses using antifungal drugs. Here, we report the characterization of the  Fus3 ortholog in , designated MpkB. We demonstrate that MpkB is important for conidiation and that its deletion induces a copious increase of dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin production. Simultaneous deletion of  and , the latter related to maintenance of the cell wall integrity, normalized DHN-melanin production. Localization studies revealed that MpkB translocates into the nuclei when  germlings are exposed to caspofungin stress, and this is dependent on the cross-talk interaction with MpkA. Additionally, DHN-melanin formation was also increased after deletion of genes coding for the Gα protein GpaA and for the G protein-coupled receptor GprM. Yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that GpaA and GprM interact, suggesting their role in the MpkB signaling cascade. is the most important airborne human pathogenic fungus, causing thousands of deaths per year. Its lethality is due to late and often inaccurate diagnosis and the lack of efficient therapeutics. The failure of efficient prophylaxis and therapy is based on the ability of this pathogen to activate numerous salvage pathways that are capable of overcoming the different drug-derived stresses. A major role in the protection of  is played by melanins. Melanins are cell wall-associated macromolecules classified as virulence determinants. The understanding of the various signaling pathways acting in this organism can be used to elucidate the mechanism beyond melanin production and help to identify ideal drug targets."

Oxygen is one variable environmental factor, and properly adapting to changes in oxygen levels is critical to prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and other cytotoxic factors. Thus, oxygen-sensing proteins are important, and among these, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent prolyl hydroxylases are highly conserved throughout evolution.  expresses two such enzymes, TgPHYa, which regulates the SCF-ubiquitin ligase complex, and TgPHYb. To characterize TgPHYb, we created a  strain that conditionally expresses TgPHYb and report that TgPHYb is required for optimal parasite growth under normal growth conditions. However, exposing TgPHYb-depleted parasites to extracellular stress leads to severe decreases in parasite invasion, which is likely due to decreased abundance of parasite adhesins. Adhesin protein abundance is reduced in TgPHYb-depleted parasites as a result of inactivation of the protein synthesis elongation factor eEF2 that is accompanied by decreased rates of translational elongation. In contrast to most other oxygen-sensing proteins that mediate cellular responses to low O, TgPHYb is specifically required for parasite growth and protein synthesis at high, but not low, O tensions as well as resistance to reactive oxygen species. , reduced TgPHYb expression leads to lower parasite burdens in oxygen-rich tissues. Taken together, these data identify TgPHYb as a sensor of high O levels, in contrast to TgPHYa, which supports the parasite at low O Because oxygen plays a key role in the growth of many organisms, cells must know how much oxygen is available. O-sensing proteins are therefore critical cellular factors, and prolyl hydroxylases are the best-studied type of O-sensing proteins. In general, prolyl hydroxylases trigger cellular responses to decreased oxygen availability. But, how does a cell react to high levels of oxygen? Using the protozoan parasite , we discovered a prolyl hydroxylase that allows the parasite to grow at elevated oxygen levels and does so by regulating protein synthesis. Loss of this enzyme also reduces parasite burden in oxygen-rich tissues, indicating that sensing both high and low levels of oxygen impacts the growth and physiology of ."

Pathogenesis is thought to be driven by the tissue-specific tropisms displayed by these viruses. For example, many picornaviruses can infect the heart and cause viral myocarditis. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a rodent pathogen that causes myocarditis in rodent models and has been used to model this biology. However, the receptor and entry requirements for this virus are poorly understood. L. E. Bazzone, M. King, C. R. MacKay, P. P. Kyawe, et al. (mBio 10:e02734-18, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.02734-18) tackled this problem using CRISPR knockout screening in human cells that are susceptible to EMCV and identified ADAM9 as an essential entry factor for EMCV in mouse and human cells. Since the extracellular domain but not the enzymatic activity or intracellular domain is required for infection, the data suggest that ADAM9 acts as an entry receptor or at an early step in the process, shedding light on the biology of EMCV infection and pathogenesis.",

            "#text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 as a novel etiological agent of severe respiratory disease in humans. As during infection by other viruses, host sensing of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces several antiviral pathways. These include interferon (IFN), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L, and protein kinase R (PKR). Coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, potently suppress the activation of these pathways, inducing only modest host responses. Our study describes the functions of two accessory proteins unique to MERS-CoV and related viruses, NS4a and NS4b, during infection in human airway epithelium-derived A549 cells. NS4a has been previously characterized as a dsRNA binding protein, while NS4b is a 2',5'-phosphodiesterase with structural and enzymatic similarity to NS2 encoded by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). We found that deletion of NS4a results in increased interferon lambda () expression, as does mutation of either the catalytic site or nuclear localization sequence of NS4b. All of the mutant viruses we tested exhibited slight decreases in replication. We previously reported that, like MHV NS2, NS4b antagonizes OAS-RNase L, but suppression of IFN is a previously unidentified function for viral phosphodiesterases. Unexpectedly, deletion of NS4a does not result in robust activation of the PKR or OAS-RNase L pathways. Therefore, MERS-CoV likely encodes other proteins that contribute to suppression or evasion of these antiviral innate immune pathways that should be an important focus of future work. This study provides additional insight into the complex interactions between MERS-CoV and the host immune response. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the second novel zoonotic coronavirus to emerge in the 21st century and cause outbreaks of severe respiratory disease. More than 2,200 cases and 800 deaths have been reported to date, yet there are no licensed vaccines or treatments. Coronaviruses encode unique accessory proteins that are not required for replication but most likely play roles in immune antagonism and/or pathogenesis. Our study describes the functions of MERS-CoV accessory proteins NS4a and NS4b during infection of a human airway-derived cell line. Loss of these accessory proteins during MERS-CoV infection leads to host antiviral activation and modestly attenuates replication. In the case of both NS4a and NS4b, we have identified roles during infection not previously described, yet the lack of robust activation suggests much remains to be learned about the interactions between MERS-CoV and the infected host."

            "#text": "The latent HIV reservoir is generated following HIV infection of activated effector CD4 T cells, which then transition to a memory phenotype. Here, we describe an  method, called QUECEL (iescent ffector ll atency), that mimics this process efficiently and allows production of large numbers of latently infected CD4 T cells. Naïve CD4 T cells were polarized into the four major T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg) and subsequently infected with a single-round reporter virus which expressed GFP/CD8a. The infected cells were purified and coerced into quiescence using a defined cocktail of cytokines, including tumor growth factor beta, interleukin-10 (IL-10), and IL-8, producing a homogeneous population of latently infected cells. Flow cytometry and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) demonstrated that the cells maintained the correct polarization phenotypes and had withdrawn from the cell cycle. Key pathways and gene sets enriched during transition from quiescence to reactivation include E2F targets, GM checkpoint, estrogen response late gene expression, and c-myc targets. Reactivation of HIV by latency-reversing agents (LRAs) closely mimics RNA induction profiles seen in cells from well-suppressed HIV patient samples using the envelope detection of  transcription sequencing (EDITS) assay. Since homogeneous populations of latently infected cells can be recovered, the QUECEL model has an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and has been extremely consistent and reproducible in numerous experiments performed during the last 4 years. The ease, efficiency, and accuracy of the mimicking of physiological conditions make the QUECEL model a robust and reproducible tool to study the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV latency. Current primary cell models for HIV latency correlate poorly with the reactivation behavior of patient cells. We have developed a new model, called QUECEL, which generates a large and homogenous population of latently infected CD4 memory cells. By purifying HIV-infected cells and inducing cell quiescence with a defined cocktail of cytokines, we have eliminated the largest problems with previous primary cell models of HIV latency: variable infection levels, ill-defined polarization states, and inefficient shutdown of cellular transcription. Latency reversal in the QUECEL model by a wide range of agents correlates strongly with RNA induction in patient samples. This scalable and highly reproducible model of HIV latency will permit detailed analysis of cellular mechanisms controlling HIV latency and reactivation."

            "#text": "is an extensively studied stress-induced toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. The toxin MazF is an endoribonuclease that cleaves RNAs at ACA sites. By that means, under stress, the induced MazF generates a stress-induced translation machinery (STM) composed of MazF-processed mRNAs and selective ribosomes that specifically translate the processed mRNAs. Here, we performed a proteomic analysis of all the  stress-induced proteins that are mediated through the chromosomally borne  gene. We show that the mRNAs of almost all of them are characterized by the presence of an ACA site up to 100 nucleotides upstream of the AUG initiator. Therefore, under stressful conditions, induced MazF processes mRNAs that are translated by STM. Furthermore, the presence of the ACA sites far upstream (up to 100 nucleotides) of the AUG initiator may still permit translation by the canonical translation machinery. Thus, such dual-translation mechanisms enable the bacterium under stress also to prepare proteins for immediate functions while coming back to normal growth conditions. The stress response, the strategy that bacteria have developed in order to cope up with all kinds of adverse conditions, is so far understood at the level of transcription. Our previous findings of a uniquely modified stress-induced translation machinery (STM) generated in  under stress by the endoribonucleolytic activity of the toxin MazF opens a new chapter in understanding microbial physiology under stress at the translational level. Here, we performed a proteomic analysis of all the  stress-induced proteins that are mediated by chromosomally borne MazF through STM."

Empirical data detailing the long-term population dynamics of nosocomial pathogens provide information about how pathogens adapt in the face of exposure to diverse antimicrobial agents and other host and environmental pressures and can inform infection control priorities. Extensive sequencing of clinical isolates from one hospital spanning a decade and a second hospital in the Cleveland, OH, metropolitan area over a 3-year time period provided high-resolution genomic analysis of the  metapopulation. Genomic analysis demonstrated an almost complete replacement of the predominant strain groups with a new, genetically distinct strain group during the study period. The new group, termed clade F, differs from other global clone 2 (GC2) strains of  in several ways, including its antibiotic resistance and lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis genes. Clade F strains are part of a large phylogenetic group with broad geographic representation. Phylogenetic analysis of single-nucleotide variants in core genome regions showed that although the Cleveland strains are phylogenetically distinct from those isolated from other locations, extensive intermixing of strains from the two hospital systems was apparent, suggesting either substantial exchange of strains or a shared, but geographically restricted, external pool from which infectious isolates were drawn. These findings document the rapid evolution of  strains in two hospitals, with replacement of the predominant clade by a new clade with altered lipooligosaccharide loci and resistance gene repertoires. Multidrug-resistant (MDR)  is a difficult-to-treat health care-associated pathogen. Knowing the resistance genes present in isolates causing infection aids in empirical treatment selection. Furthermore, knowledge of the genetic background can assist in tracking patterns of transmission to limit the spread of infections in hospitals. The appearance of a new genetic background in  strains with a different set of resistance genes and cell surface structures suggests that strong selective pressures exist, even in highly MDR pathogens. Because the new strains have levels of antimicrobial resistance similar to those of the strains that were displaced, we hypothesize that other features, including host colonization and infection, may confer additional selective advantages and contribute to their increased prevalence."

In this review, we describe the little-studied biphasic metabolic dynamics of the macrophage response during progression of infection by  and discuss their relevance to macrophage immunity and  pathogenicity. The early phase of macrophage infection, which is marked by M1 polarization, is accompanied by a metabolic switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α)-mediated aerobic glycolysis (also known as the Warburg effect in cancer cells), as well as by an upregulation of pathways involving oxidative and antioxidative defense responses, arginine metabolism, and synthesis of bioactive lipids. These early metabolic changes are followed by a late adaptation/resolution phase in which macrophages transition from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, with a consequent dampening of macrophage proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses. Importantly, the identification of upregulated metabolic pathways and/or metabolic regulatory mechanisms with immunomodulatory functions during M1 polarization has revealed novel mechanisms of  pathogenicity. These advances can lead to the development of novel host-directed therapies to facilitate bacterial clearance in tuberculosis by targeting the metabolic state of immune cells."

            "#text": "Recognition of functional receptors by viruses is a key determinant for their host range, tissue tropism, and disease potential. The highly pathogenic Lassa virus (LASV) currently represents one of the most important emerging pathogens. The major cellular receptor for LASV in human cells is the ubiquitously expressed and evolutionary highly conserved extracellular matrix receptor dystroglycan (DG). In the host, DG interacts with many cellular proteins in a tissue-specific manner. The resulting distinct supramolecular complexes likely represent the functional units for viral entry, and preexisting protein-protein interactions may critically influence DG's function in productive viral entry. Using an unbiased shotgun proteomic approach, we define the largely unknown molecular composition of DG complexes present in highly susceptible epithelial cells that represent important targets for LASV during viral transmission. We further show that the specific composition of cellular DG complexes can affect DG's function in receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virus. Under steady-state conditions, epithelial DG complexes underwent rapid turnover via an endocytic pathway that shared some characteristics with DG-mediated LASV entry. However, compared to steady-state uptake of DG, LASV entry via DG occurred faster and critically depended on additional signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases and the downstream effector p21-activating kinase. In sum, we show that the specific molecular composition of DG complexes in susceptible cells is a determinant for productive virus entry and that the pathogen can manipulate the existing DG-linked endocytic pathway. This highlights another level of complexity of virus-receptor interaction and provides possible cellular targets for therapeutic antiviral intervention. Recognition of cellular receptors allows emerging viruses to break species barriers and is an important determinant for their disease potential. Many virus receptors have complex tissue-specific interactomes, and preexisting protein-protein interactions may influence their function. Combining shotgun proteomics with a biochemical approach, we characterize the molecular composition of the functional receptor complexes used by the highly pathogenic Lassa virus (LASV) to invade susceptible human cells. We show that the specific composition of the receptor complexes affects productive entry of the virus, providing proof-of-concept. In uninfected cells, these functional receptor complexes undergo dynamic turnover involving an endocytic pathway that shares some characteristics with viral entry. However, steady-state receptor uptake and virus endocytosis critically differ in kinetics and underlying signaling, indicating that the pathogen can manipulate the receptor complex according to its needs. Our study highlights a remarkable complexity of LASV-receptor interaction and identifies possible targets for therapeutic antiviral intervention."

While glycosphingolipids are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, the presence of GSL-2 in  is surprising since GSLs had previously been found only in  species, in which they play a role in outer membrane integrity. In this paper, we identify three proteins required for GSL-2 synthesis: CcbF catalyzes the first step in ceramide synthesis, while Sgt1 and Sgt2 sequentially glycosylate ceramides to produce GSL-2. Unlike in , GSLs are nonessential in ; however, the presence of ceramides does contribute to phage resistance and susceptibility to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B. The identification of a novel lipid species specifically produced upon phosphate starvation suggests that bacteria may be able to synthesize a wider variety of lipids in response to stresses than previously observed. Uncovering these lipids and their functional relevance will provide greater insight into microbial physiology and environmental adaptation. Bacteria adapt to environmental changes in a variety of ways, including altering their cell shape.  adapts to phosphate starvation by elongating its cell body and a polar stalk structure containing both inner and outer membranes. While we generally think of cellular membranes being composed largely of phospholipids, cellular elongation occurs when environmental phosphate, and therefore phospholipid synthesis, is limited. In order to adapt to these environmental constraints,  synthesizes several glycolipid species, including a novel glycosphingolipid. This finding is significant because glycosphingolipids, while ubiquitous in eukaryotes, are extremely rare in bacteria. In this paper, we identify three proteins required for GSL-2 synthesis and demonstrate that they contribute to phage resistance. These findings suggest that bacteria may synthesize a wider variety of lipids in response to stresses than previously observed."

        "Abstract": "After an adaptive immune response is mounted, gammaherpesviruses achieve persistence through the utilization of viral noncoding RNAs to craft a suitable host cell environment in an immunologically transparent manner. While gammaherpesvirus long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs have been recognized for some time and have been actively investigated, a recent spate of reports have now identified repertoires of the circular RNA (circRNA) class of noncoding RNAs in both the lymphocryptovirus and rhadinovirus genera of gammaherpesviruses. Despite the recent nature of these findings, the detection of circRNAs across viruses and viral gene expression programs, the conservation of some viral circRNAs, and their detection in the clinical setting already raises the spectrum of functional importance in gammaherpesvirus biology and associated malignancies. Here, we provide an overview of currently known gammaherpesvirus circular RNAs and discuss reported physical and contextual properties that may be germane to future functional studies. With the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) circRNAome being the most extensively studied to date, our discussions will be weighted toward EBV circRNAs while also addressing circRNAs discovered in the rhesus macaque lymphocryptovirus (rLCV), the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and the murid gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68). We hope that this will help set the stage for future investigations into the functions and relevance of this new class of viral noncoding RNAs in infection and disease.",

Mercury toxicity has been linked to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but Hg does not directly perform redox chemistry with oxygen. How exposure to the ionic form, Hg(II), generates ROS is unknown. Exposure of  to Hg(II) triggered ROS accumulation and increased transcription and activity of superoxide dismutase (Sod) and pseudocatalase (Pcat); however, Hg(II) inactivated Sod and Pcat. Strains lacking Sod or Pcat had increased oxidized bacillithiol (BSH) levels and were more sensitive to Hg(II) than the wild type. The Δ Δ and Δ Δ double mutant strains were as sensitive to Hg(II) as the Δ strain that lacks bacillithiol, suggesting that the increased sensitivity to Hg(II) in the Δ and Δ mutant strains is due to a decrease of reduced BSH. Treatment of  with Hg(II) decreased aconitase activity and increased the intracellular concentration of free Fe, and these phenotypes were exacerbated in Δ and Δ mutant strains. Treatment with Hg(II) also increased DNA damage. We conclude that sequestration of the redox buffering thiol BSH by Hg(II), in conjunction with direct inactivation of ROS-scavenging enzymes, impairs the ability of  to effectively metabolize ROS generated as a normal consequence of growth in aerobic environments. is a deep-branching thermophilic aerobe.

            "b": "IMPORTANCE",
            "#text": "Human antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus is limited by antigenic drift resulting from amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain. Glycan addition can cause large antigenic changes but is limited by fitness costs to viral replication. Here, we report that glycans are added to H1 and H3 HAs at discrete 5-to-7-year intervals, until they reach a functional glycan limit, after which glycans are swapped at approximately 2-fold-longer intervals. Consistent with this pattern, 2009 pandemic H1N1 added a glycan at residue N162 over the 2015-2016 season, an addition that required two epistatic HA head mutations for complete glycosylation. These strains rapidly replaced H1N1 strains globally, by 2017 dominating H3N2 and influenza B virus strains for the season. The pattern of glycan modulation that we outline should aid efforts for tracing the epidemic potential of evolving human IAV strains. Frequent mutation of its major antibody target, the glycoprotein hemagglutinin, ensures that the influenza virus is perennially both a rapidly emerging virus and a major threat to public health. One type of mutation escapes immunity by adding a glycan onto an area of hemagglutinin that many antibodies recognize. This study revealed that these glycan changes follow a simple temporal pattern. Every 5 to 7 years, hemagglutinin adds a new glycan, up to a limit. After this limit is reached, no net additions of glycans occur. Instead, glycans are swapped or lost at longer intervals. Eventually, a pandemic replaces the terminally glycosylated hemagglutinin with a minimally glycosylated one from the animal reservoir, restarting the cycle. This pattern suggests the following: (i) some hemagglutinins are evolved for this decades-long process, which is both defined by and limited by successive glycan addition; and (ii) hemagglutinin's antibody dominance and its capacity for mutations are highly adapted features that allow influenza to outpace our antibody-based immunity."

In this work, we characterize the contributions of previously identified mechanisms of triazole resistance, including mutations in the sterol-demethylase-encoding gene , overexpression of sterol-demethylase genes, and overexpression of the efflux pump-encoding gene , among a large collection of highly triazole-resistant clinical  isolates. Upon revealing that these mechanisms alone cannot substantiate the majority of triazole resistance exhibited by this collection, we subsequently describe the identification and characterization of a novel genetic determinant of triazole resistance. Mutations in the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase-encoding gene, , were identified in a majority of triazole-resistant clinical isolates in our collection. Introduction of three different  mutations, predicted to encode residue alterations in the conserved sterol sensing domain of Hmg1, resulted in significantly increased resistance to the triazole class of agents. Additionally, correction of a  mutation in a pan-triazole-resistant clinical isolate of  with a novel Cas9-ribonucleoprotein-mediated system was shown to restore clinical susceptibility to all triazole agents. Mutations in  were also shown to lead to the accumulation of ergosterol precursors, such as eburicol, by sterol profiling, while not altering the expression of sterol-demethylase genes. is the predominant pathogen of invasive aspergillosis, a disease state credited with over 200,000 life-threatening infections annually. The triazole class of antifungals are clinically essential to the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. Unfortunately, resistance to the triazoles among  isolates is now increasingly reported worldwide. In this work, we challenge the current paradigm of clinical triazole resistance in , by first demonstrating that previously characterized mechanisms of resistance have nominal impact on triazole susceptibility and subsequently identifying a novel mechanism of resistance with a profound impact on clinical triazole susceptibility. We demonstrate that mutations in the HMG-CoA reductase gene, , are common among resistant clinical isolates and that  mutations confer resistance to all clinically available triazole antifungals."

        "Abstract": "Since 2014, acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a long-recognized condition associated with polioviruses, nonpolio enteroviruses, and various other viral and nonviral causes, has been reemerging globally in epidemic form. This unanticipated reemergence is ironic, given that polioviruses, once the major causes of AFM, are now at the very threshold of global eradication and cannot therefore explain any aspect of AFM reemergence. Instead, the new AFM epidemic has been temporally associated with reemergences of nonpolio enteroviruses such as EV-D68, until recently thought to be an obscure virus of extremely low endemicity. This perspective reviews the enigmatic epidemiologic, virologic, and diagnostic aspects of epidemic AFM reemergence; examines current options for clinical management; discusses future research needs; and suggests that the AFM epidemic offers important clues to mechanisms of viral disease emergence.",

Organization of these components lends spatial organization to the biofilm community such that biofilm residents can benefit from the production of common goods while being protected from exogenous insults. Spatial organization is driven by the presence of chemical gradients, such as oxygen. Here we show that two quinol oxidases found in  and other bacteria organize along the biofilm oxygen gradient and that this spatially coordinated expression controls architectural integrity. Cytochrome , a high-affinity quinol oxidase required for aerobic respiration under hypoxic conditions, is the most abundantly expressed respiratory complex in the biofilm community. Depletion of the cytochrome expressing subpopulation compromises biofilm complexity by reducing the abundance of secreted extracellular matrix as well as increasing cellular sensitivity to exogenous stresses. Interrogation of the distribution of quinol oxidases in the planktonic state revealed that ∼15% of the population expresses cytochrome  at atmospheric oxygen concentration, and this population dominates during acute urinary tract infection. These data point toward a bet-hedging mechanism in which heterogeneous expression of respiratory complexes ensures respiratory plasticity of  across diverse host niches. Biofilms are multicellular bacterial communities encased in a self-secreted extracellular matrix comprised of polysaccharides, proteinaceous fibers, and DNA. Organization of these components lends spatial organization in the biofilm community. Here we demonstrate that oxygen gradients in uropathogenic  (UPEC) biofilms lead to spatially distinct expression programs for quinol oxidases-components of the terminal electron transport chain. Our studies reveal that the cytochrome -expressing subpopulation is critical for biofilm development and matrix production. In addition, we show that quinol oxidases are heterogeneously expressed in planktonic populations and that this respiratory heterogeneity provides a fitness advantage during infection. These studies define the contributions of quinol oxidases to biofilm physiology and suggest the presence of respiratory bet-hedging behavior in UPEC."

CIB. A truncated AccS protein that contains only the soluble C-terminal autokinase module (AccS') accounts for the succinate-dependent CCR control assays with purified AccS' revealed its autophosphorylation, phosphotransfer from AccS'∼P to the Asp60 residue of AccR, and the phosphatase activity toward its phosphorylated response regulator, indicating that the equilibrium between the kinase and phosphatase activities of AccS' may control the phosphorylation state of the AccR transcriptional regulator. Oxidized quinones, e.g., ubiquinone 0 and menadione, switched the AccS' autokinase activity off, and three conserved Cys residues, which are not essential for catalysis, are involved in such inhibition. Thiol oxidation by quinones caused a change in the oligomeric state of the AccS' dimer resulting in the formation of an inactive monomer. This thiol-based redox switch is tuned by the cellular energy state, which can change depending on the carbon source that the cells are using. This work expands the functional diversity of redox-sensitive sensor kinases, showing that they can control new bacterial processes such as CCR of the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds. The AccSR two-component system is conserved in the genomes of some betaproteobacteria, where it might play a more general role in controlling the global metabolic state according to carbon availability. Two-component signal transduction systems comprise a sensor histidine kinase and its cognate response regulator, and some have evolved to sense and convert redox signals into regulatory outputs that allow bacteria to adapt to the altered redox environment. The work presented here expands knowledge of the functional diversity of redox-sensing kinases to control carbon catabolite repression (CCR), a phenomenon that allows the selective assimilation of a preferred compound among a mixture of several carbon sources. The newly characterized AccS sensor kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of the AccR master regulator involved in CCR of the anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds in the betaproteobacterium  sp. CIB. AccS seems to have a thiol-based redox switch that is modulated by the redox state of the quinone pool. The AccSR system is conserved in several betaproteobacteria, where it might play a more general role controlling their global metabolic state."

PhoP furthers its activation by promoting Lon-mediated degradation of EIIA at acidic pH. These results suggest that  ensures robust activation of its virulence system by suspending the activation of PhoP until a sufficient level of active PhoP is present to overcome the inhibitory effect of EIIA Our findings reveal how a pathogen precisely and efficiently operates its virulence program during infection. To accomplish successful infection, pathogens must operate their virulence programs in a precise, time-sensitive, and coordinated manner. A major question is how pathogens control the timing of virulence gene expression during infection. Here we report that the intracellular pathogen  controls the timing and level of virulence gene expression by using an inhibitory protein, EIIA A DNA binding master virulence regulator, PhoP, controls various virulence genes inside acidic phagosomes.  decreases EIIA amounts at acidic pH in a Lon- and PhoP-dependent manner. This, in turn, promotes expression of the PhoP-activated virulence program because EIIA hampers activation of PhoP-regulated genes by interfering with PhoP binding to DNA. EIIA enables  to impede the activation of PhoP-regulated gene expression inside macrophages. Our findings suggest that  achieves programmed delay of virulence gene activation by adjusting levels of an inhibitory factor."

            "#text": "The effectiveness of influenza vaccines against circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses was modest for several seasons despite the absence of antigenic drift of hemagglutinin (HA), the primary vaccine component. Since antibodies against HA and neuraminidase (NA) contribute independently to protection against disease, antigenic changes in NA may allow A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses to escape from vaccine-induced immunity. In this study, analysis of the specificities of human NA-specific monoclonal antibodies identified antigenic sites that have changed over time. The impact of these differences on  inhibition of enzyme activity was not evident for polyclonal antisera until viruses emerged in 2013 without a predicted glycosylation site at amino acid 386 in NA. Phylogenetic and antigenic cartography demonstrated significant antigenic changes that in most cases aligned with genetic differences. Typical of NA drift, the antigenic difference is observed in one direction, with antibodies against conserved antigenic domains in A/California/7/2009 (CA/09) continuing to inhibit NA of recent A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses reasonably well. However, ferret CA/09-specific antiserum that inhibited the NA of A/Michigan/45/2015 (MI/15) very well , protected mice against lethal MI/15 infection poorly. These data show that antiserum against the homologous antigen is most effective and suggest the antigenic properties of NA should not be overlooked when selecting viruses for vaccine production. The effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines against circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses has been modest in recent years, despite the absence of antigenic drift of HA, the primary vaccine component. Human monoclonal antibodies identified antigenic sites in NA that changed early after the new pandemic virus emerged. The reactivity of ferret antisera demonstrated antigenic drift of A(H1N1)pdm09 NA from 2013 onward. Passive transfer of serum raised against A/California/7/2009 was less effective than ferret serum against the homologous virus in protecting mice against a virus with the NA of more recent virus, A/Michigan/45/2015. Given the long-standing observation that NA-inhibiting antibodies are associated with resistance against disease in humans, these data demonstrate the importance of evaluating NA drift and suggest that vaccine effectiveness might be improved by selecting viruses for vaccine production that have NAs antigenically similar to those of circulating influenza viruses."

            "#text": "The filamentous fungus  is a common postharvest contaminant of food and feed, and some strains are plant pathogens. Many processes in  are triggered by light. Interestingly, blue light inhibits sporulation, and red light reverses the effect, suggesting interactions between light-sensing systems. The genome encodes a phytochrome (FphA), a white collar 1 (WC-1) orthologue (LreA), an opsin (NopA), and a cryptochrome (CryA) as putative photoreceptors. Here, we investigated the role of FphA and LreA and the interplay with the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. We created loss-of function mutations for , , and  using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Sporulation was reduced in all three mutant strains already in the dark, suggesting functions of the photoreceptors FphA and LreA independent of light perception. Germination of conidia was delayed in red, blue, green, and far-red light. We found that light induction of  (lock-ontrolled ene in  and light-induced gene in ) and the catalase gene  depended on FphA, LreA, and HogA. Light induction of  (a putative ferrochelatase gene) and  ( light regulated, unknown function) required LreA and HogA but not FphA. Blue- and green-light stimulation of alternariol formation depended on LreA. A lack of FphA or LreA led to enhanced resistance toward oxidative stress due to the upregulation of catalases and superoxide dismutases. Light activation of FphA resulted in increased phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of HogA. Our results show that germination, sporulation, and secondary metabolism are light regulated in  with distinct and overlapping roles of blue- and red-light photosensors. Light controls many processes in filamentous fungi. The study of light regulation in a number of model organisms revealed an unexpected complexity. Although the molecular components for light sensing appear to be widely conserved in fungal genomes, the regulatory circuits and the sensitivity of certain species toward specific wavelengths seem different. In , most light responses are triggered by blue light, whereas in , red light plays a dominant role. In , both blue and red light appear to be important. In , photoreceptors control morphogenetic pathways, the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species, and the production of secondary metabolites. On the other hand, high-osmolarity sensing required FphA and LreA, indicating a sophisticated cross talk between light and stress signaling."

            "#text": "The endemic human JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immune-suppressed patients. The mechanisms of virus infection  are not understood because the major target cells for virus in the brain do not express virus receptors and do not bind virus. We found that JCPyV associates with extracellular vesicles (EVs) and can infect target cells independently of virus receptors. Virus particles were found packaged inside extracellular vesicles and attached to the outer side of vesicles. Anti-JCPyV antisera reduced infection by purified virus but had no effect on infection by EV-associated virus. Treatment of cells with the receptor-destroying enzyme neuraminidase inhibited infection with purified virus but did not inhibit infection by EV-associated virus. Mutant pseudoviruses defective in sialic acid receptor binding could not transduce cells as purified pseudovirions but could do so when associated with EVs. This alternative mechanism of infection likely plays a critical role in the dissemination and spread of JCPyV both to and within the central nervous system. JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen that causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a severe and often fatal neurodegenerative disease in immunocompromised or immunomodulated patients. The mechanisms responsible for initiating infection in susceptible cells are not completely known. The major attachment receptor for the virus, lactoseries tetrasaccharide c (LSTc), is paradoxically not expressed on oligodendrocytes or astrocytes in human brain, and virus does not bind to these cells. Because these are the major cell types targeted by the virus in the brain, we hypothesized that alternative mechanisms of infection must be responsible. Here we provide evidence that JCPyV is packaged in extracellular vesicles from infected cells. Infection of target cells by vesicle-associated virus is not dependent on LSTc and is not neutralized by antisera directed against the virus. This is the first demonstration of a polyomavirus using extracellular vesicles as a means of transmission."

            "#text": "5GB1 is an obligate methylotroph which grows on methane or methanol with similar growth rates. It has long been assumed that the core metabolic pathways must be similar on the two substrates, but recent studies of methane metabolism in this bacterium suggest that growth on methanol might have significant differences from growth on methane. In this study, both a targeted metabolomics approach and a C tracer approach were taken to understand core carbon metabolism in  5GB1 during growth on methanol and to determine whether such differences occur. Our results suggest a systematic shift of active core metabolism in which increased flux occurred through both the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway and the partial serine cycle, while the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was incomplete, in contrast to growth on methane. Using the experimental results as constraints, we applied flux balance analysis to determine the metabolic flux phenotype of  5GB1 growing on methanol, and the results are consistent with predictions based on ATP and NADH changes. Transcriptomics analysis suggested that the changes in fluxes and metabolite levels represented results of posttranscriptional regulation. The combination of flux balance analysis of the genome-scale model and the flux ratio from C data changed the solution space for a better prediction of cell behavior and demonstrated the significant differences in physiology between growth on methane and growth on methanol. One-carbon compounds such as methane and methanol are of increasing interest as sustainable substrates for biological production of fuels and industrial chemicals. The bacteria that carry out these conversions have been studied for many decades, but gaps exist in our knowledge of their metabolic pathways. One such gap is the difference between growth on methane and growth on methanol. Understanding such metabolism is important, since each has advantages and disadvantages as a feedstock for production of chemicals and fuels. The significance of our research is in the demonstration that the metabolic network is substantially altered in each case and in the delineation of these changes. The resulting new insights into the core metabolism of this bacterium now provide an improved basis for future strain design."

            "#text": "The  genus of the  family encompasses numerous enveloped plus-strand RNA viruses. Dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus, is the leading cause of serious arthropod-borne disease globally. The genomes of DENV, like the genomes of yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile fever virus (WNV), or Zika virus (ZIKV), control their translation by a 5'-terminal capping group. Three other genera of  are remarkable because their viruses use internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) to control translation, and they are not arthropod transmitted. In 2006, E. Harris' group published work suggesting that DENV RNA does not stringently need a cap for translation. They proposed that instead DENV translation is controlled by an interplay between 5' and 3' termini. Here we present evidence that the DENV or ZIKV 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) alone have IRES competence. This conclusion is based, first, on the observation that uncapped monocistronic mRNAs 5' terminated with the DENV or ZIKV 5'-UTRs can efficiently direct translation of a reporter gene in BHK and C6/36 cells and second, that either 5'-UTR placed between two reporter genes can efficiently induce expression of the downstream gene in BHK cells but not in C6/36 cells. These experiments followed observations that uncapped DENV/ZIKV genomic transcripts, 5' terminated with pppAN… or GpppAN…, can initiate infections of mammalian (BHK) or mosquito (C6/36) cells. IRES competence of the 5'-UTRs of DENV/ZIKV raises many open questions regarding the biology and control, as well as the evolution, of insect-borne flaviviruses. Members of the genus  of  are important human pathogens of great concern because they cause serious diseases, sometimes death, in human populations living in tropical, subtropical (dengue virus [DENV], Zika virus [ZIKV], and yellow fever virus), or moderate climates (West Nile virus). Flaviviruses are known to control their translation by a cap-dependent mechanism. We have observed, however, that the uncapped genomes of DENV or ZIKV can initiate infection of mammalian and insect cells. We provide evidence that the short 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of DENV or ZIKV genomes can fulfill the function of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). This strategy frees these organisms from the cap-dependent mechanism of gene expression at an as yet unknown stage of proliferation. The data raise new questions about the biology and evolution of flaviviruses, possibly leading to new controls of flavivirus disease."

The LolABCDE proteins make up the machinery for lipoprotein trafficking from the inner membrane (IM) across the periplasm to the outer membrane (OM). The Lol apparatus is additionally responsible for differentiating OM lipoproteins from those for the IM. In , a default sorting mechanism has been proposed whereby an aspartic acid at position +2 of the mature lipoproteins prevents Lol recognition and leads to their IM retention. In other bacteria, the conservation of sequences immediately following the acylated cysteine is variable.

Our work shows that Lol proteins recognize a wide range of signals, consisting of an acylated cysteine and a specific conformation of the adjacent domain, determining IM retention or transport to the OM. Gram-negative bacteria build their outer membranes (OM) from components that are initially located in the inner membrane (IM). A fraction of lipoproteins is transferred to the OM by the transport machinery consisting of LolABCDE proteins.

These findings question the nature of IM retention signals, identified in  as aspartate at position +2 of mature lipoproteins. We propose an alternative model for the sorting of IM and OM lipoproteins based on their relative affinities for the IM and the ability of the promiscuous sorting machinery to deliver lipoproteins to their functional sites in the OM."

            "#text": "Small molecules are the primary communication media of the microbial world. Recent bioinformatic studies, exploring the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) which produce many small molecules, have highlighted the incredible biochemical potential of the signaling molecules encoded by the human microbiome. Thus far, most research efforts have focused on understanding the social language of the gut microbiome, leaving crucial signaling molecules produced by oral bacteria and their connection to health versus disease in need of investigation. In this study, a total of 4,915 BGCs were identified across 461 genomes representing a broad taxonomic diversity of oral bacteria. Sequence similarity networking provided a putative product class for more than 100 unclassified novel BGCs. The newly identified BGCs were cross-referenced against 254 metagenomes and metatranscriptomes derived from individuals either with good oral health or with dental caries or periodontitis. This analysis revealed 2,473 BGCs, which were differentially represented across the oral microbiomes associated with health versus disease. Coabundance network analysis identified numerous inverse correlations between BGCs and specific oral taxa. These correlations were present in healthy individuals but greatly reduced in individuals with dental caries, which may suggest a defect in colonization resistance. Finally, corroborating mass spectrometry identified several compounds with homology to products of the predicted BGC classes. Together, these findings greatly expand the number of known biosynthetic pathways present in the oral microbiome and provide an atlas for experimental characterization of these abundant, yet poorly understood, molecules and socio-chemical relationships, which impact the development of caries and periodontitis, two of the world's most common chronic diseases. The healthy oral microbiome is symbiotic with the human host, importantly providing colonization resistance against potential pathogens. Dental caries and periodontitis are two of the world's most common and costly chronic infectious diseases and are caused by a localized dysbiosis of the oral microbiome. Bacterially produced small molecules, often encoded by BGCs, are the primary communication media of bacterial communities and play a crucial, yet largely unknown, role in the transition from health to dysbiosis. This study provides a comprehensive mapping of the BGC repertoire of the human oral microbiome and identifies major differences in health compared to disease. Furthermore, BGC representation and expression is linked to the abundance of particular oral bacterial taxa in health versus dental caries and periodontitis. Overall, this study provides a significant insight into the chemical communication network of the healthy oral microbiome and how it devolves in the case of two prominent diseases."

To track microbial dynamics during acute exacerbations, a CF rapid response (CFRR) strategy was developed. The CFRR relies on viromics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics data to rapidly monitor active members of the viral and microbial community during acute CF exacerbations. To highlight CFRR, a case study of a CF patient is presented, in which an abrupt decline in lung function characterized a fatal exacerbation. The microbial community in the patient's lungs was closely monitored through the multi-omics strategy, which led to the identification of pathogenic shigatoxigenic  (STEC) expressing Shiga toxin. This case study illustrates the potential for the CFRR to deconstruct complicated disease dynamics and provide clinicians with alternative treatments to improve the outcomes of pulmonary exacerbations and expand the life spans of individuals with CF. Proper management of polymicrobial infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has extended their life span. Information about the composition and dynamics of each patient's microbial community aids in the selection of appropriate treatment of pulmonary exacerbations. We propose the cystic fibrosis rapid response (CFRR) as a fast approach to determine viral and microbial community composition and activity during CF pulmonary exacerbations. The CFRR potential is illustrated with a case study in which a cystic fibrosis fatal exacerbation was characterized by the presence of shigatoxigenic  The incorporation of the CFRR within the CF clinic could increase the life span and quality of life of CF patients."

We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on a collection of 207 ST11 and closely related ST258 isolates of human and veterinary/environmental origin, comprising 16 RTs collected from Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America. Core genome single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis identified multiple intraspecies and interspecies clonal groups (isolates separated by ≤2 core genome SNVs) in all the major RT sublineages: 078, 126, 127, 033, and 288. Clonal groups comprised isolates spread across different states, countries, and continents, indicative of reciprocal long-range dissemination and possible zoonotic/anthroponotic transmission. Antimicrobial resistance genotypes and phenotypes varied across host species, geographic regions, and RTs and included macrolide/lincosamide resistance (Tn []), tetracycline resistance (Tn [] and Tn []), and fluoroquinolone resistance (/ mutations), as well as numerous aminoglycoside resistance cassettes.

Using high-resolution genomics, we investigated the evolution and zoonotic potential of ST11 and a new closely related ST258 lineage sourced from diverse origins. We found multiple intra- and interspecies clonal transmission events in all ribotype sublineages. Clones were spread across multiple continents, often without any health care association, indicative of zoonotic/anthroponotic long-range dissemination in the community.

Mice expressing both LMP2A and  transgenes (LMP2A/λ-) develop tumors significantly faster than mice only expressing  (λ-). Previously, we demonstrated the cell cycle inhibitor p27 is present at significantly lower levels in LMP2A/λ- mice due to increased posttranslational degradation. P27 degradation can occur in the cytoplasm following phosphorylation on serine 10 (S10) or in the nucleus via the SCF complex, which depends on Cks1. We previously demonstrated an S10A knock-in of p27 (p27) that prevented S10 phosphorylation failed to significantly delay tumor onset in LMP2A/λ- mice. We also previously demonstrated that a  knockout partially delayed tumor onset in LMP2A/λ- mice, but onset was still significantly faster than that in λ- mice. Here, we have combined both genetic manipulations in what we call p27 mice. LMP2A/λ-/p27 mice and λ-/p27 mice both displayed dramatic delays in tumor onset. Strikingly, tumor development in LMP2A/λ-/p27 mice was later than that in λ- mice and not significantly different from that in λ-/p27 mice. The p27 genotype also normalized G-S-phase cell cycle progression, spleen size, and splenic architecture in LMP2A/λ- mice. Our results reveal both major pathways of p27 degradation are required for the accelerated BL development driven by LMP2A in our BL model and that blocking both degradation pathways is sufficient to delay Myc-driven tumor development with or without LMP2A. BL is a cancer that primarily affects children. The side effects of chemotherapy highlight the need for better BL treatments. Many BL tumors contain EBV, and our goal is to determine what makes EBV-positive BL different from EBV-negative BL. This may lead to more specific treatments for both types. All cases of BL require overexpression of  Mice engineered to express EBV LMP2A along with  (LMP2A/λ- mice) develop tumors much more quickly than mice only expressing  (λ- mice). Blocking degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor protein p27 in LMP2A/λ- mice causes tumors to develop later than in λ- mice, showing that p27 degradation may play a larger role in EBV-positive BL than EBV-negative BL. Furthermore, our studies suggest the cell cycle is an attractive target as a treatment option for LMP2A-positive cancers in humans."

They also show promise as sustainably produced electronic materials. Until now, microbially produced conductive protein filaments have been reported only for bacteria. We report here that the archaellum of  is electrically conductive. This is the first demonstration that electrically conductive protein filaments have evolved in  Furthermore, the structure of the  archaellum was previously determined (N. Poweleit, P. Ge, H. N. Nguyen, R. R. O. Loo, et al., Nat Microbiol 2:16222, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.222). Thus, the archaellum of  is the first microbially produced electrically conductive protein filament for which a structure is known. We analyzed the previously published structure and identified a core of tightly packed phenylalanines that is one likely route for electron conductance. The availability of the  archaellum structure is expected to substantially advance mechanistic evaluation of long-range electron transport in microbially produced electrically conductive filaments and to aid in the design of \"green\" electronic materials that can be microbially produced with renewable feedstocks. Microbially produced electrically conductive protein filaments are a revolutionary, sustainably produced, electronic material with broad potential applications. The design of new protein nanowires based on the known  archaellum structure could be a major advance over the current empirical design of synthetic protein nanowires from electrically conductive bacterial pili. An understanding of the diversity of outer-surface protein structures capable of electron transfer is important for developing models for microbial electrical communication with other cells and minerals in natural anaerobic environments. Extracellular electron exchange is also essential in engineered environments such as bioelectrochemical devices and anaerobic digesters converting wastes to methane. The finding that the archaellum of  is electrically conductive suggests that some archaea might be able to make long-range electrical connections with their external environment."

We investigated Baltic Sea sediments with single-cell genomics, metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and enzyme assays to identify possible subsistence mechanisms employed by uncultured , ,  group OPB41, , , , , , and  marine group II lineages. Some functions appeared to be shared by multiple lineages, such as trehalose production and NAD-consuming deacetylation, both of which have been shown to increase cellular life spans in other organisms by stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids, respectively. Other possible subsistence mechanisms differed between lineages, possibly providing them different physiological niches. Enzyme assays and transcripts suggested that  and  group OPB41 catabolized sugars, whereas  and  catabolized peptides. Metabolite and transcript data suggested that  utilized allantoin, possibly as an energetic substrate or chemical protectant, and also possessed energy-efficient sodium pumps.  single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) recruited transcripts for full pathways for the production of all 20 canonical amino acids, and the gene for amino acid exporter YddG was one of their most highly transcribed genes, suggesting that they may benefit from metabolic interdependence with other cells. Subsistence of uncultured phyla in deep subsurface sediments may occur through shared strategies of using chemical protectants for biomolecular stabilization, but also by differentiating into physiological niches and metabolic interdependencies. Much of life on Earth exists in a very slow-growing state, with microbes from deeply buried marine sediments representing an extreme example. These environments are like natural laboratories that have run multi-thousand-year experiments that are impossible to perform in a laboratory. We borrowed some techniques that are commonly used in laboratory experiments and applied them to these natural samples to make hypotheses about how these microbes subsist for so long at low activity. We found that some methods for stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids might be used by many members of the community. We also found evidence for niche differentiation strategies, and possibly cross-feeding, suggesting that even though they are barely growing, complex ecological interactions continue to occur over ultralong timescales."

Here, we demonstrate that another MarR family member, EmrR, is required for virulence of  Typhimurium and another enteric bacterium,  EmrR is found to activate transcription of an array of virulence determinants, including  pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) genes and several divergent operons, which have been shown to be activated by SlyA and the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system. We studied the regulatory effect of EmrR on one of these genetic loci, i.e., the  divergent operon, and characterized a catecholamine neurotransmitter, dopamine, as an EmrR-sensed signal. Dopamine acts on EmrR to reduce its ability to bind to the target promoters, thus functioning as a negative signal to downregulate this EmrR-activated transcription. EmrR can bind to AT-rich sequences, which particularly overlap the SlyA and PhoP binding sites in the  divergent promoter. EmrR is a priming transcription regulator that binds its target promoters prior to successive transcription activators, by which it displaces universal silencer H-NS from these promoters and facilitates successive regulators to bind these regions. Regulation of the -specific gene in  and  reveals that EmrR-dependent regulation is conserved in enteric bacteria. These observations suggest that EmrR is a transcription activator to control the expression of virulence genes, including the SPI-2 genes. Dopamine can act on the EmrR-mediated signal transduction, thus downregulating expression of these virulence factors. In this study, MarR family regulator EmrR is identified as a novel virulence factor of enteric bacteria, here exemplified by  serovar Typhimurium and  EmrR exerts an essential effect as a transcription activator for expression of virulence determinants, including  pathogenicity island 2 genes and a set of horizontally acquired genetic loci that formed divergent operons. EmrR senses the neurotransmitter dopamine and is subsequently released from target promoters, resulting in downregulation of the virulence gene expression. Through this action on EmrR, dopamine can weaken  resistance against host defense mechanisms. This provides an explanation for the previous observation that dopamine inhibits bacterial infection in animal gastrointestinal tracts. Our findings provide evidence that this neurotransmitter can modulate bacterial gene expression through interaction with virulence regulator EmrR."

            "#text": "Homologous chromosome number (ploidy) has diversified among bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes over evolution. In bacteria, model organisms such as  possess a single chromosome encoding the entire genome during slow growth. In contrast, other bacteria, including cyanobacteria, maintain multiple copies of individual chromosomes (polyploid). Although a correlation between ploidy level and cell size has been observed in bacteria and eukaryotes, it is poorly understood how replication of multicopy chromosomes is regulated and how ploidy level is adjusted to cell size. In addition, the advantages conferred by polyploidy are largely unknown. Here we show that only one or a few multicopy chromosomes are replicated at once in the cyanobacterium  and that this restriction depends on regulation of DnaA activity. Inhibiting the DnaA intrinsic ATPase activity in  increased the number of replicating chromosomes and chromosome number per cell but did not affect cell growth. In contrast, when cell growth rate was increased or decreased, DnaA level, DnaA activity, and the number of replicating chromosomes also increased or decreased in parallel, resulting in nearly constant chromosome copy number per unit of cell volume at constant temperature. When chromosome copy number was increased by inhibition of DnaA ATPase activity or reduced culture temperature, cells exhibited greater resistance to UV light. Thus, it is suggested that the stepwise replication of the genome enables cyanobacteria to maintain nearly constant gene copy number per unit of cell volume and that multicopy chromosomes function as backup genetic information to compensate for genomic damage. Polyploidy has evolved many times across the kingdom of life. The relationship between cell growth and chromosome replication in bacteria has been studied extensively in monoploid model organisms such as  but not in polyploid organisms. Our study of the polyploid cyanobacterium  demonstrates that replicating chromosome number is restricted and regulated by DnaA to maintain a relatively stable gene copy number/cell volume ratio during cell growth. In addition, our results suggest that polyploidy confers resistance to UV, which damages DNA. This compensatory polyploidy is likely necessitated by photosynthesis, which requires sunlight and generates damaging reactive oxygen species, and may also explain how polyploid bacteria can adapt to extreme environments with high risk of DNA damage."

Western blotting confirmed that cytosolic  LPS failed to signal through caspase-11, as shown by the lack of gasdermin D, caspase-1, or IL-1β proteolytic cleavage.

            "#text": "Protein kinase R (PKR) plays a major role in activating host immunity during infection by sensing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced by viruses. Once activated by dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates the translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), halting cellular translation. Many viruses have methods of inhibiting PKR activation or its downstream effects, circumventing protein synthesis shutdown. These include sequestering dsRNA or producing proteins that bind to and inhibit PKR activation. Here we describe our finding that in multiple cell types, PKR was depleted during mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1) infection. MAV-1 did not appear to be targeting PKR at the transcriptional or translational level, because total PKR mRNA levels and levels of PKR mRNA bound to polysomes were unchanged or increased during MAV-1 infection. However, inhibiting the proteasome reduced the PKR depletion seen in MAV-1-infected cells, whereas inhibiting the lysosome had no effect. This suggests that proteasomal degradation alone is responsible for PKR degradation during MAV-1 infection. Time course experiments indicated that the degradation occurs early after infection. Infecting cells with UV-inactivated virus prevented PKR degradation, whereas inhibiting viral DNA replication did not. Together, these results suggest that an early viral gene is responsible. Degradation of PKR is a rare mechanism to oppose PKR activity, and it has been described in only six RNA viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a DNA virus counteracting PKR by degrading it. The first line of defense in cells during viral infection is the innate immune system, which is activated by different viral products. PKR is a part of this innate immune system and is induced by interferon and activated by dsRNA produced by DNA and RNA viruses. PKR is such an important part of the antiviral response that many viral families have gene products to counteract its activation or the resulting effects of its activity. Although a few RNA viruses degrade PKR, this method of counteracting PKR has not been reported for any DNA viruses. MAV-1 does not encode virus-associated RNAs, a human adenoviral defense against PKR activation. Instead, MAV-1 degrades PKR, and it is the first DNA virus reported to do so. The innate immune evasion by PKR degradation is a previously unidentified way for a DNA virus to circumvent the host antiviral response."

The estimates of mutation rates using the GFP-FACS approach are similar to those calculated with other reporters, and the method was used to assess if different alleles of the mismatch repair pathway gene  impact the mutation rates in the human pathogen  The approach could be extended to other microbes and applications, opening the way for a better understanding of how mutation rates have impacted speciation and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance."

Despite decades of active research, attempts to develop of a live attenuated virus (LAV) vaccine against TBEV with acceptable safety and immunogenicity characteristics have not been successful. To overcome this impasse, we generated a chimeric TBEV that was highly immunogenic in nonhuman primates (NHPs). The chimeric virus contains the prM/E genes of TBEV, which are expressed in the genetic background of an antigenically closely related, but less pathogenic member of the TBEV complex-Langat virus (LGTV), strain T-1674. The neurovirulence of this chimeric virus was subsequently controlled by robust targeting of the viral genome with multiple copies of central nervous system-enriched microRNAs (miRNAs). This miRNA-targeted T/1674-mirV2 virus was highly stable in Vero cells and was not pathogenic in various mouse models of infection or in NHPs. Importantly, in NHPs, a single dose of the T/1674-mirV2 virus induced TBEV-specific neutralizing antibody (NA) levels comparable to those seen with a three-dose regimen of an inactivated TBEV vaccine, currently available in Europe. Moreover, our vaccine candidate provided complete protection against a stringent wild-type TBEV challenge in mice and against challenge with a parental (not miRNA-targeted) chimeric TBEV/LGTV in NHPs. Thus, this highly attenuated and immunogenic T/1674-mirV2 virus is a promising LAV vaccine candidate against TBEV and warrants further preclinical evaluation of its neurovirulence in NHPs prior to entering clinical trials in humans. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is one of the most medically important tick-borne pathogens of the Old World. Despite decades of active research, efforts to develop of TBEV live attenuated virus (LAV) vaccines with acceptable safety and immunogenicity characteristics have not been successful. Here we report the development and evaluation of a highly attenuated and immunogenic microRNA-targeted TBEV LAV."

In microbial eukaryotes like , trogocytosis is used to kill host cells. In multicellular eukaryotes, trogocytosis is used for cell killing and cell-cell communication in a variety of contexts. Thus, nibbling is an emerging theme in cell-cell interactions both within and between species. When trogocytosis occurs between mammalian immune cells, cell membrane proteins from the nibbled cell are acquired and displayed by the recipient cell. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that through trogocytosis, amoebae acquire and display human cell membrane proteins. We demonstrate that  acquires and displays human cell membrane proteins through trogocytosis and that this leads to protection from lysis by human serum. Protection from human serum occurs only after amoebae have undergone trogocytosis of live cells but not phagocytosis of dead cells. Likewise, mutant amoebae defective in phagocytosis, but unaltered in their capacity to perform trogocytosis, are protected from human serum. Our studies are the first to reveal that amoebae can display human cell membrane proteins and suggest that the acquisition and display of membrane proteins is a general feature of trogocytosis. These studies have major implications for interactions between  and the immune system and also reveal a novel strategy for immune evasion by a pathogen. Since other microbial eukaryotes use trogocytosis for cell killing, our findings may apply to the pathogenesis of other infections. causes amoebiasis, a potentially fatal diarrheal disease. Abscesses in organs such as the liver can occur when amoebae are able to breach the intestinal wall and travel through the bloodstream to other areas of the body. Therefore, understanding how  evades immune detection is of great interest. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that  acquires and displays human cell membrane proteins by taking \"bites\" of human cell material in a process named trogocytosis (\"trogo-\" means \"nibble\"), and that this allows amoebae to survive in human serum. Display of acquired proteins through trogocytosis has been previously characterized only in mammalian immune cells. Our study suggests that this is a more general feature of trogocytosis not restricted to immune cells and broadens our knowledge of eukaryotic biology. These findings also reveal a novel strategy for immune evasion by a pathogen and may apply to the pathogenesis of other infections."

            "#text": "The clinical presentation of severe  malaria differs between children and adults, but the mechanistic basis for this remains unclear. Contributing factors to disease severity include total parasite biomass and the diverse cytoadhesive properties mediated by the polymorphic  gene parasite ligand family displayed on infected erythrocytes. To explore these factors, we performed a multicohort analysis of the contribution of  expression and parasite biomass to severe malaria in two previously published pediatric cohorts in Tanzania and Malawi and an adult cohort in India. Machine learning analysis revealed independent and complementary roles for  adhesion types and parasite biomass in adult and pediatric severe malaria and showed that similar  profiles, including upregulation of group A and DC8 , predict severe malaria in adults and children. Among adults, patients with multiorgan complications presented infections with significantly higher parasite biomass without significant differences in  adhesion types. Conversely, pediatric patients with specific complications showed distinct  signatures. Cerebral malaria patients showed broadly increased expression of  genes, in particular group A and DC8 , while children with severe malaria anemia were classified based on high transcription of DC8  only. This study represents the first large multisite meta-analysis of  expression, and it demonstrates the presence of common  profiles in severe malaria patients of different ages across distant geographical sites, as well as syndrome-specific disease signatures. The complex associations between parasite biomass,  adhesion type, and clinical presentation revealed here represent the most comprehensive picture so far of the relationship between cytoadhesion, parasite load, and clinical syndrome. malaria can cause multiple disease complications that differ by patient age. Previous studies have attempted to address the roles of parasite adhesion and biomass in disease severity; however, these studies have been limited to single geographical sites, and there is limited understanding of how parasite adhesion and biomass interact to influence disease manifestations. In this meta-analysis, we compared parasite disease determinants in African children and Indian adults. This study demonstrates that parasite biomass and specific subsets of  genes are independently associated with detrimental outcomes in both childhood and adult malaria. We also explored how parasite  adhesion types and biomass play different roles in the development of specific severe malaria pathologies, including childhood cerebral malaria and multiorgan complications in adults. This work represents the largest study to date of the role of both  adhesion types and biomass in severe malaria."

Currently, we know little about the molecular details of this shear-stress-dependent interaction. Using single-molecule atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that vWF binds to the  surface protein A (SpA) via a previously undescribed force-sensitive mechanism. We identify an extremely strong SpA-vWF interaction, capable of withstanding forces of ∼2 nN, both in laboratory and in clinically relevant methicillin-resistant  (MRSA) strains. Strong bonds are activated by mechanical stress, consistent with flow experiments revealing that bacteria adhere in larger amounts to vWF surfaces when the shear rate is increased. We suggest that force-enhanced adhesion may involve conformational changes in vWF. Under force, elongation of vWF may lead to the exposure of a high-affinity cryptic SpA-binding site to which bacteria firmly attach. In addition, force-induced structural changes in the SpA domains may also promote strong, high-affinity binding. This force-regulated interaction might be of medical importance as it may play a role in bacterial adherence to platelets and to damaged blood vessels. protein A (SpA) binds to von Willebrand factor (vWF) under flow. While vWF binding to SpA plays a role in  adherence to platelets and endothelial cells under shear stress, the molecular basis of this stress-dependent interaction has not yet been elucidated. Here we show that the SpA-vWF interaction is regulated by a new force-dependent mechanism. The results suggest that mechanical extension of vWF may lead to the exposure of a high-affinity cryptic SpA-binding site, consistent with the shear force-controlled functions of vWF. Moreover, strong binding may be promoted by force-induced structural changes in the SpA domains. This study highlights the role of mechanoregulation in controlling the adhesion of  and shows promise for the design of small inhibitors capable of blocking colonization under high shear stress."

We have previously reported that it uses MYR-dependent translocation of dense granule proteins to elicit a key set of host responses related to the cell cycle, specifically, E2F transcription factor targets, including cyclin E. We report here the identification of a novel  effector protein that is exported from the parasitophorous vacuole in a MYR1-dependent manner and localizes to the host's nucleus. Parasites lacking this inducer of ost yclin  (HCE1) are unable to modulate E2F transcription factor target genes and exhibit a substantial growth defect. Immunoprecipitation of HCE1 from infected host cells showed that HCE1 efficiently binds elements of the cyclin E regulatory complex, namely, DP1 and its partners E2F3 and E2F4. Expression of HCE1 in , or in uninfected human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), showed localization of the expressed protein to the host nuclei and strong cyclin E upregulation. Thus, HCE1 is a novel effector protein that is necessary and sufficient to impact the E2F axis of transcription, resulting in co-opting of host functions to the advantage of  Like most Apicomplexan parasites,  has the remarkable ability to invade and establish a replicative niche within another eukaryotic cell, in this case, any of a large number of cell types in almost any warm-blooded animals. Part of the process of establishing this niche is the export of effector proteins to co-opt host cell functions in favor of the parasite. Here we identify a novel effector protein, HCE1, that the parasites export into the nucleus of human cells, where it modulates the expression of multiple genes, including the gene encoding cyclin E, one of the most crucial proteins involved in controlling when and whether a human cell divides. We show that HCE1 works through binding to specific transcription factors, namely, E2F3, E2F4, and DP1, that normally carefully regulate these all-important pathways. This represents a new way in which these consummately efficient infectious agents co-opt the human cells that they so efficiently grow within."

Most MccA precursors, encoded by validated  operons from diverse bacteria, are 7 amino acids long, but the significance of this precursor length conservation has remained unclear. Here, we created derivatives of  operons encoding longer precursors and studied their synthesis and bioactivities. We found that increasing the precursor length to 11 amino acids and beyond strongly decreased antibiotic production. We found this decrease to depend on several parameters. First, reiterative synthesis of the MccA peptide by the ribosome was decreased at longer  open reading frames, leading to less efficient competition with other messenger RNAs. Second, the presence of a formyl group at the N-terminal methionine of the heptameric peptide had a strong stimulatory effect on adenylation by the MccB enzyme. No such formyl group stimulation was observed for longer peptides. Finally, the presence of the N-terminal formyl on the heptapeptide adenylate stimulated bioactivity, most likely at the uptake stage. Together, these factors should contribute to optimal activity of McC-like compounds as 7-amino-acid peptide moieties and suggest convergent evolution of several steps of the antibiotic biosynthesis pathway and their adjustment to sensitive cell uptake machinery to create a potent drug. microcin C (McC) is a representative member of peptide-nucleotide antibiotics produced by diverse microorganisms. The vast majority of biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for McC-like compound production encode 7-amino-acid-long precursor peptides, which are C-terminally modified by dedicated biosynthetic enzymes with a nucleotide moiety to produce a bioactive compound. In contrast, the sequences of McC-like compound precursor peptides are not conserved. Here, we studied the consequences of  McC precursor peptide length increase on antibiotic production and activity. We show that increasing the precursor peptide length strongly decreases McC production by affecting multiple biosynthetic steps, suggesting that the McC biosynthesis system has evolved under significant functional constraints to maintain the precursor peptide length."

            "#text": "The global spread of  chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) variant haplotypes earlier caused the widespread loss of chloroquine (CQ) efficacy. In Asia, novel PfCRT mutations that emerged on the Dd2 allelic background have recently been implicated in high-level resistance to piperaquine, and N326S and I356T have been associated with genetic backgrounds in which resistance emerged to artemisinin derivatives. By analyzing large-scale genome sequencing data, we report that the predominant Asian CQ-resistant Dd2 haplotype is undetectable in Africa. Instead, the GB4 and previously unexplored Cam783 haplotypes predominate, along with wild-type, drug-sensitive PfCRT that has reemerged as the major haplotype. To interrogate how these alleles impact drug susceptibility, we generated -modified isogenic parasite lines spanning the mutational interval between GB4 and Dd2, which includes Cam783 and involves amino acid substitutions at residues 326 and 356. Relative to Dd2, the GB4 and Cam783 alleles were observed to mediate lower degrees of resistance to CQ and the first-line drug amodiaquine, while resulting in higher growth rates. These findings suggest that differences in growth rates, a surrogate of parasite fitness, influence selection in the context of African infections that are frequently characterized by high transmission rates, mixed infections, increased immunity, and less recourse to treatment. We also observe that the Asian Dd2 allele affords partial protection against piperaquine yet does not directly impact artemisinin efficacy. Our results can help inform the regional recommendations of antimalarials, whose activity is influenced by and, in certain cases, enhanced against select PfCRT variant haplotypes. Our study defines the allelic distribution of , an important mediator of multidrug resistance in , in Africa and Asia. We leveraged whole-genome sequence analysis and gene editing to demonstrate how current drug combinations can select different allelic variants of this gene and shape region-specific parasite population structures. We document the ability of PfCRT mutations to modulate parasite susceptibility to current antimalarials in dissimilar,  allele-specific ways. This study underscores the importance of actively monitoring  genotypes to identify emerging patterns of multidrug resistance and help guide region-specific treatment options."

This raises questions about how these chemosynthetic bacteria survive across oxygen and sulfur gradients and how their mode of survival impacts the environment. Here, we use growth experiments, proteomics, and cryo-electron tomography to show that a SUP05 isolate, \" Thioglobus autotrophicus,\" is amorphous in shape and several times larger and stores considerably more intracellular sulfur when it respires oxygen. We also show that these cells can use diverse sources of reduced organic and inorganic sulfur at submicromolar concentrations. Enhanced cell size, carbon content, and metabolic activity of the aerobic phenotype are likely facilitated by a stabilizing surface-layer (S-layer) and an uncharacterized form of FtsZ-less cell division that supports morphological plasticity. The additional sulfur storage provides an energy source that allows cells to continue metabolic activity when exogenous sulfur sources are not available. This metabolic flexibility leads to the production of more organic carbon in the ocean than is estimated based solely on their anaerobic phenotype. Identifying shifts in microbial metabolism across redox gradients will improve efforts to model marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) ecosystems. Here, we show that aerobic morphology and metabolism increase cell size, sulfur storage capacity, and carbon fixation rates in \" Thioglobus autotrophicus,\" a chemosynthetic bacterium from the SUP05 clade that crosses oxic-anoxic boundaries."

This tactical behavior relies on a motility structure, which is guided by a chemosensory system. Environmental signals are sensed by membrane-inserted chemosensory receptors that are organized in large ordered arrays. While the cellular positioning of the chemotaxis machinery and that of the flagellum have been studied in detail in bacteria, we have little knowledge about the localization of such macromolecular assemblies in archaea. Although the archaeal motility structure, the archaellum, is fundamentally different from the flagellum, archaea have received the chemosensory machinery from bacteria and have connected this system with the archaellum. Here, we applied a combination of time-lapse imaging and fluorescence and electron microscopy using the model euryarchaeon  and found that archaella were specifically present at the cell poles of actively dividing rod-shaped cells. The chemosensory arrays also had a polar preference, but in addition, several smaller arrays moved freely in the lateral membranes. In the stationary phase, rod-shaped cells became round and chemosensory arrays were disassembled. The positioning of archaella and that of chemosensory arrays are not interdependent and likely require an independent form of positioning machinery. This work showed that, in the rod-shaped haloarchaeal cells, the positioning of the archaellum and of the chemosensory arrays is regulated in time and in space. These insights into the cellular organization of  suggest the presence of an active mechanism responsible for the positioning of macromolecular protein complexes in archaea. Archaea are ubiquitous single cellular microorganisms that play important ecological roles in nature. The intracellular organization of archaeal cells is among the unresolved mysteries of archaeal biology. With this work, we show that cells of haloarchaea are polarized. The cellular positioning of proteins involved in chemotaxis and motility is spatially and temporally organized in these cells. This suggests the presence of a specific mechanism responsible for the positioning of macromolecular protein complexes in archaea."

            "#text": "Nontypeable  (NTHi) is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that is adapted exclusively to human hosts. NTHi utilizes sialic acid from the host as a carbon source and as a terminal sugar on the outer membrane glycolipid lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Sialic acid expressed on LOS is critical in NTHi biofilm formation and immune evasion. There are two major forms of sialic acids in most mammals, -acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and -glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), the latter of which is derived from Neu5Ac. Humans lack the enzyme to convert Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc and do not express Neu5Gc in normal tissues; instead, Neu5Gc is recognized as a foreign antigen. A recent study showed that dietary Neu5Gc can be acquired by NTHi colonizing humans and then presented on LOS, which acts as an antigen for the initial induction of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Here we examined Neu5Gc uptake and presentation on NTHi LOS. We show that, although Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac are utilized equally well as sole carbon sources, Neu5Gc is not incorporated efficiently into LOS. When equal amounts of Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac are provided in culture media, there is ∼4-fold more Neu5Ac incorporated into LOS, suggesting a bias in a step of the LOS biosynthetic pathway. CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase (SiaB) was shown to have ∼4,000-fold-higher catalytic efficiency for Neu5Ac than for Neu5Gc. These data suggest that NTHi has adapted preferential utilization of Neu5Ac, thus avoiding presentation of the nonhuman Neu5Gc in the bacterial cell surface. The selective pressure for this adaptation may represent the human antibody response to the Neu5Gc xenoantigen. Host-adapted bacterial pathogens such as NTHi cannot survive out of their host environment and have evolved host-specific mechanisms to obtain nutrients and evade the immune response. Relatively few of these host adaptations have been characterized at the molecular level. NTHi utilizes sialic acid as a nutrient and also incorporates this sugar into LOS, which is important in biofilm formation and immune evasion. In the present study, we showed that NTHi has evolved to preferentially utilize the Neu5Ac form of sialic acid. This adaptation is due to the substrate preference of the enzyme CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase, which synthesizes the activated form of Neu5Ac for macromolecule biosynthesis. This adaptation allows NTHi to evade killing by a human antibody response against the nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc."

            "#text": "Viral infections induce proinflammatory signaling cascades and inflammatory cytokine production, which is precisely regulated for host benefits. In the current study, we unravel a previously unappreciated role of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC-IIA) as a negative regulator in inflammatory responses. We identified that cell surface NMHC-IIA recognized sialic acids on sialylated RNA viruses during early infections and interacted with an immune adaptor DNAX activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) to recruit downstream spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), leading to suppressed virus-triggered proinflammatory responses. More importantly, recognition of sialylated RNA viruses or sialic acid mimics by NMHC-IIA was shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory responses via the DAP12-Syk pathway. These findings uncover a novel negative regulation mechanism of proinflammatory responses and provide a molecular basis to design anti-inflammatory drugs. NMHC-IIA, a subunit of nonmuscle myosin IIA (NM-IIA), takes part in diverse physiological processes, including cell movement, cell shape maintenance, and signal transduction. Recently, NMHC-IIA has been demonstrated to be a receptor or factor contributing to viral infections. Here, we identified that NMHC-IIA recognizes sialic acids on sialylated RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Upon recognition, NMHC-IIA associates with the transmembrane region of DAP12 to recruit Syk. Activation of the DAP12-Syk pathway impairs the host antiviral proinflammatory cytokine production and signaling cascades. More importantly, sialic acid mimics and sialylated RNA viruses enable the antagonism of LPS-triggered proinflammatory responses through engaging the NMHC-IIA-DAP12-Syk pathway. These results actually support that NMHC-IIA is involved in negative modulation of the host innate immune system, which provides a molecular basis for prevention and control of the sialylated RNA viruses and treatment of inflammatory diseases."

            "#text": "The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system that is poorly understood. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, has long been associated with bacterial infections and inflammation-causing immunosenescence. Recent studies examining the intestinal microbiota of AD patients revealed that their microbiome differs from that of subjects without dementia. In this work, we prospectively enrolled 108 nursing home elders and followed each for up to 5 months, collecting longitudinal stool samples from which we performed metagenomic sequencing and  T84 intestinal epithelial cell functional assays for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression, a critical mediator of intestinal homeostasis. Our analysis identified clinical parameters as well as numerous microbial taxa and functional genes that act as predictors of AD dementia in comparison to elders without dementia or with other dementia types. We further demonstrate that stool samples from elders with AD can induce lower P-gp expression levels  those samples from elders without dementia or with other dementia types. We also paired functional studies with machine learning approaches to identify bacterial species differentiating the microbiome of AD elders from that of elders without dementia, which in turn are accurate predictors of the loss of dysregulation of the P-gp pathway. We observed that the microbiome of AD elders shows a lower proportion and prevalence of bacteria with the potential to synthesize butyrate, as well as higher abundances of taxa that are known to cause proinflammatory states. Therefore, a potential nexus between the intestinal microbiome and AD is the modulation of intestinal homeostasis by increases in inflammatory, and decreases in anti-inflammatory, microbial metabolism. Studies of the intestinal microbiome and AD have demonstrated associations with microbiome composition at the genus level among matched cohorts. We move this body of literature forward by more deeply investigating microbiome composition via metagenomics and by comparing AD patients against those without dementia and with other dementia types. We also exploit machine learning approaches that combine both metagenomic and clinical data. Finally, our functional studies using stool samples from elders demonstrate how the c microbiome of AD elders can affect intestinal health via dysregulation of the P-glycoprotein pathway. P-glycoprotein dysregulation contributes directly to inflammatory disorders of the intestine. Since AD has been long thought to be linked to chronic bacterial infections as a possible etiology, our findings therefore fill a gap in knowledge in the field of AD research by identifying a nexus between the microbiome, loss of intestinal homeostasis, and inflammation that may underlie this neurodegenerative disorder."

            "#text": "Numerous, diverse, highly variable defense and offense genetic systems are encoded in most bacterial genomes and are involved in various forms of conflict among competing microbes or their eukaryotic hosts. Here we focus on the offense and self-versus-nonself discrimination systems encoded by archaeal genomes that so far have remained largely uncharacterized and unannotated. Specifically, we analyze archaeal genomic loci encoding polymorphic and related toxin systems and ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides. Using sensitive methods for sequence comparison and the \"guilt by association\" approach, we identified such systems in 141 archaeal genomes. These toxins can be classified into four major groups based on the structure of the components involved in the toxin delivery. The toxin domains are often shared between and within each system. We revisit halocin families and substantially expand the halocin C8 family, which was identified in diverse archaeal genomes and also certain bacteria. Finally, we employ features of protein sequences and genomic locus organization characteristic of archaeocins and polymorphic toxins to identify candidates for analogous but not necessarily homologous systems among uncharacterized protein families. This work confidently predicts that more than 1,600 archaeal proteins, currently annotated as \"hypothetical\" in public databases, are components of conflict and self-versus-nonself discrimination systems. Diverse and highly variable systems involved in biological conflicts and self-versus-nonself discrimination are ubiquitous in bacteria but much less studied in archaea. We performed comprehensive comparative genomic analyses of the archaeal systems that share components with analogous bacterial systems and propose an approach to identify new systems that could be involved in these functions. We predict polymorphic toxin systems in 141 archaeal genomes and identify new, archaea-specific toxin and immunity protein families. These systems are widely represented in archaea and are predicted to play major roles in interactions between species and in intermicrobial conflicts. This work is expected to stimulate experimental research to advance the understanding of poorly characterized major aspects of archaeal biology."

            "#text": "We previously reported that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist Eritoran blocks acute lung injury (ALI) therapeutically in mouse and cotton rat models of influenza. However, secondary (2°) bacterial infection following influenza virus infection is associated with excess morbidity and mortality. Wild-type (WT) mice infected with mouse-adapted influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR8) and, 7 days later, with  serotype 3 () exhibited significantly enhanced lung pathology and lethality that was reversed by Eritoran therapy after PR8 infection but before  infection. Cotton rats infected with nonadapted pH1N1 influenza virus and then superinfected with methicillin-resistant  also exhibited increased lung pathology and serum high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) levels, both of which were blunted by Eritoran therapy. In mice, PR8 infection suppressed -induced CXCL1 and CXCL2 mRNA, reducing neutrophil infiltration and increasing the bacterial burden, all of which were reversed by Eritoran treatment. While beta interferon (IFN-β)-deficient (IFN-β) mice are highly susceptible to PR8, they exhibited delayed death upon  superinfection, indicating that while IFN-β was protective against influenza, it negatively impacted the host response to  IFN-β-treated WT macrophages selectively suppressed -induced CXCL1/CXCL2 transcriptionally, as evidenced by reduced recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the CXCL1 promoter. Thus, influenza establishes a \"trained\" state of immunosuppression toward 2° bacterial infection, in part through the potent induction of IFN-β and its downstream transcriptional regulation of chemokines, an effect reversed by Eritoran. Enhanced susceptibility to 2° bacterial infections following infection with influenza virus is a global health concern that accounts for many hospitalizations and deaths, particularly during pandemics. The complexity of the impaired host immune response during 2° bacterial infection has been widely studied. Both type I IFN and neutrophil dysfunction through decreased chemokine production have been implicated as mechanisms underlying enhanced susceptibility to 2° bacterial infections. Our findings support the conclusion that selective suppression of CXCL1/CXCL2 represents an IFN-β-mediated \"training\" of the macrophage transcriptional response to TLR2 agonists and that blocking of TLR4 therapeutically with Eritoran after influenza virus infection reverses this suppression by blunting influenza-induced IFN-β."

To establish these biochemical links, we leveraged andom arcode rasposon uencing (RB-TnSeq), a genome-wide assay measuring the fitness of thousands of genes in parallel, to identify multiple novel enzymes in both l- and d-lysine metabolism. We first describe three pathway enzymes that catabolize l-2-aminoadipate (l-2AA) to 2-ketoglutarate (2KG), connecting d-lysine to the TCA cycle. One of these enzymes,  5260 (PP_5260), contains a DUF1338 domain, representing a family with no previously described biological function. Our work also identified the recently described coenzyme A (CoA)-independent route of l-lysine degradation that results in metabolization to succinate. We expanded on previous findings by demonstrating that glutarate hydroxylase CsiD is promiscuous in its 2-oxoacid selectivity. Proteomics of selected pathway enzymes revealed that expression of catabolic genes is highly sensitive to the presence of particular pathway metabolites, implying intensive local and global regulation. This work demonstrated the utility of RB-TnSeq for discovering novel metabolic pathways in even well-studied bacteria, as well as its utility a powerful tool for validating previous research. lysine metabolism can produce multiple commodity chemicals, conferring great biotechnological value.

Despite its prevalence in many domains of life, DUF1338-containing proteins have had no known biochemical function. We demonstrate that PP_5260 is a metalloenzyme which catalyzes an unusual route of decarboxylation of 2OA to d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG). Our screen also identified a recently described novel glutarate metabolic pathway. We validate previous results and expand the understanding of glutarate hydroxylase CsiD by showing that can it use either 2OA or 2KG as a cosubstrate.

            "#text": "Protein synthesis, folding, and degradation are an accurately regulated process occurring in every organism and called proteostasis. This process is essential to maintain a healthy proteome since proteostasis dysregulation is responsible for devastating cellular issues. Proteostasis is controlled by a complex network of molecular chaperones and proteases. Among them, eukaryotic Hsp90, assisted by many cochaperones and the Hsp70 chaperone system, plays a major role in activating hundreds of client proteins, and Hsp90 inhibition usually leads to proteasomal degradation of these clients. In bacteria, however, the precise function of Hsp90 remains quite unclear, and only a few clients are known. Recently, we have shown that Hsp90 is essential at elevated temperature in the aquatic model bacterium , and we have identified a client of Hsp90, TilS, involved in tRNA modification. Here we found that two members of the proteostasis network with antagonist activities, the Hsp90 chaperone and the HslVU protease, which is considered the proteasome ancestor, together regulate the level of TilS. In particular, we show that deletion of the genes coding for the HslVU protease suppresses the growth defect of an  strain with  deleted, by increasing the cellular level of the essential TilS protein. These results open up new avenues for understanding how proteostasis is controlled in bacteria, and new Hsp90 clients are much needed now to confirm the interplay between Hsp90 and proteases. Maintaining a healthy proteome is essential in every living cell from bacteria to humans. For example, proteostasis (protein homeostasis) imbalance in humans leads to devastating diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. Therefore, proteins need to be assisted from their synthesis to their native folding and ultimately to their degradation. To ensure efficient protein turnover, cells possess an intricate network of molecular chaperones and proteases for protein folding and degradation. However, these networks need to be better defined and understood. Here, using the aquatic bacterium  as a model organism, we demonstrate interplay between two proteins with antagonist activities, the Hsp90 chaperone and the HslVU protease, to finely regulate the level of an essential client of Hsp90. Therefore, this work provides a new bacterial model to better study protein regulation and turnover, and it sheds light on how proteostasis by Hsp90 and proteases could be controlled in bacteria."

Using two  species,  and , which differ in their abilities to damage epithelial tissues, we used traditional methods (pathogen CFU, host survival, and host cytokine expression) combined with high-resolution intravital imaging of transparent zebrafish larvae to illuminate host-pathogen interactions at the cellular level in the complex environment of a mucosal infection. In zebrafish,  grows as both yeast and epithelium-damaging filaments, activates the NF-κB pathway, evokes proinflammatory cytokines, and causes the recruitment of phagocytic immune cells. On the other hand,  remains in yeast morphology and elicits the recruitment of phagocytes without inducing inflammation. High-resolution mapping of phagocyte- interactions at the infection site revealed that neutrophils and macrophages attack both  species, regardless of the cytokine environment. Time-lapse monitoring of single-cell gene expression in transgenic reporter zebrafish revealed a partitioning of the immune response during  infection: the transcription factor NF-κB is activated largely in cells of the swimbladder epithelium, while the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is expressed in motile cells, mainly macrophages. Our results point to different host strategies for combatting pathogenic  species and separate signaling roles for host cell types. In modern medicine, physicians are frequently forced to balance immune suppression against immune stimulation to treat patients such as those undergoing transplants and chemotherapy. More-targeted therapies designed to preserve immunity and prevent opportunistic fungal infection in these patients could be informed by an understanding of how fungi interact with professional and nonprofessional immune cells in mucosal candidiasis. In this study, we intravitally imaged these host-pathogen dynamics during  infection in a transparent vertebrate model host, the zebrafish. Single-cell imaging revealed an unexpected partitioning of the inflammatory response between phagocytes and epithelial cells. Surprisingly, we found that  cytokine profiles more closely match  responses of epithelial cells rather than phagocytes. Furthermore, we identified a disconnect between canonical inflammatory cytokine production and phagocyte recruitment to the site of infection, implicating noncytokine chemoattractants. Our study contributes to a new appreciation for the specialization and cross talk among cell types during mucosal infection."

In the environment, free-living amoebae represent key hosts providing nutrients and shelter for highly efficient intracellular proliferation of , which eventually leads to lysis of the protist. However, the significance of other bacterial players for  ecology is poorly understood. In this study, we used a ubiquitous amoeba and bacterial endosymbiont to investigate the impact of this common association on  infection. We demonstrate that  proliferation was severely suppressed in  harboring the chlamydial symbiont  The amoebae survived the infection and were able to resume growth. Different environmental amoeba isolates containing the symbiont were equally well protected as different  isolates were diminished, suggesting ecological relevance of this symbiont-mediated defense. Furthermore, protection was not mediated by impaired  uptake. Instead, we observed reduced virulence of  released from symbiont-containing amoebae. Pronounced gene expression changes in the presence of the symbiont indicate that interference with the transition to the transmissive phase impedes the  infection. Finally, our data show that the defensive response of amoebae harboring  leaves the amoebae with superior fitness reminiscent of immunological memory. Given that mutualistic associations between bacteria and amoebae are widely distributed,  and potentially other amoeba endosymbionts could be key in shaping environmental survival, abundance, and virulence of this important pathogen, thereby affecting the frequency of human infection. Bacterial pathogens are generally investigated in the context of disease. To prevent outbreaks, it is essential to understand their lifestyle and interactions with other microbes in their natural environment.  is an important human respiratory pathogen that survives and multiplies in biofilms or intracellularly within protists, such as amoebae. Importantly, transmission to humans occurs from these environmental sources.  infection generally leads to rapid host cell lysis. It was therefore surprising to observe that amoebae, including fresh environmental isolates, were well protected during  infection when the bacterial symbiont  was also present.  was not prevented from invading amoebae but was impeded in its ability to develop fully virulent progeny and were ultimately cleared in the presence of the symbiont. This study highlights how ecology and virulence of an important human pathogen is affected by a defensive amoeba symbiont, with possibly major consequences for public health."

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, are dramatically increasing worldwide, but an understanding of the underlying factors is lacking. We here present an ecoevolutionary perspective on the emergence of inflammatory diseases. We propose that adaptation has led to fine-tuned host-microbe interactions, which are maintained by secreted host metabolites nourishing the associated microbes. A constant elevation of nutrients in the gut environment leads to an increased activity and changed functionality of the microbiota, thus severely disturbing host-microbe interactions and leading to dysbiosis and disease development. In the past, starvation and pathogen infections, causing diarrhea, were common incidences that reset the gut bacterial community to its \"human-specific-baseline.\" However, these natural clearing mechanisms have been virtually eradicated in developed countries, allowing a constant uncontrolled growth of bacteria. This leads to an increase of bacterial products that stimulate the immune system and ultimately might initiate inflammatory reactions.",

            "#text": "Marine sponges are recognized as valuable sources of bioactive metabolites and renowned as petri dishes of the sea, providing specialized niches for many symbiotic microorganisms. Sponges of the family  are well documented to be chemically talented, often containing high levels of polyhalogenated compounds, terpenoids, peptides, and other classes of bioactive small molecules. This group of tropical sponges hosts a high abundance of an uncultured filamentous cyanobacterium,  Here, we report the comparative genomic analyses of two phylogenetically distinct  populations, which reveal shared deficiencies in essential pathways, hinting at possible reasons for their uncultivable status, as well as differing biosynthetic machinery for the production of specialized metabolites. One symbiont population contains clustered genes for expanded polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE) biosynthesis, while the other instead harbors a unique gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the dysinosin nonribosomal peptides. The hybrid sequencing and assembly approach utilized here allows, for the first time, a comprehensive look into the genomes of these elusive sponge symbionts. Natural products provide the inspiration for most clinical drugs. With the rise in antibiotic resistance, it is imperative to discover new sources of chemical diversity. Bacteria living in symbiosis with marine invertebrates have emerged as an untapped source of natural chemistry. While symbiotic bacteria are often recalcitrant to growth in the lab, advances in metagenomic sequencing and assembly now make it possible to access their genetic blueprint. A cell enrichment procedure, combined with a hybrid sequencing and assembly approach, enabled detailed genomic analysis of uncultivated cyanobacterial symbiont populations in two chemically rich tropical marine sponges. These population genomes reveal a wealth of secondary metabolism potential as well as possible reasons for historical difficulties in their cultivation."

            "#text": "Mycobacterial σ belongs to the group II family of sigma factors, which are widely considered to transcribe genes required for stationary-phase survival and the response to stress. Here we explored the mechanism underlying the observed hypersensitivity of Δ deletion mutants of , , and  to rifampin (RIF) and uncovered an additional constitutive role of σ during exponential growth of mycobacteria that complements the function of the primary sigma factor, σ Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), we show that during exponential phase, σ binds to over 200 promoter regions, including those driving expression of essential housekeeping genes, like the rRNA gene. ChIP-Seq of ectopically expressed σ-FLAG demonstrated that at least 61 promoter sites are recognized by both σ and σ These results together suggest that RNA polymerase holoenzymes containing either σ or σ transcribe housekeeping genes in exponentially growing mycobacteria. The RIF sensitivity of the Δ mutant possibly reflects a decrease in the effective housekeeping holoenzyme pool, which results in susceptibility of the mutant to lower doses of RIF. Consistent with this model, overexpression of σ restores the RIF tolerance of the Δ mutant to that of the wild type, concomitantly ruling out a specialized role of σ in RIF tolerance. Although the properties of mycobacterial σ parallel those of  σ in its ability to transcribe a subset of housekeeping genes, σ presents a clear departure from the  paradigm, wherein the cellular levels of σ are tightly controlled during exponential growth, such that the transcription of housekeeping genes is initiated exclusively by a holoenzyme containing σ (E.σ). All mycobacteria encode a group II sigma factor, σ, closely related to the group I principal housekeeping sigma factor, σ Group II sigma factors are widely believed to play specialized roles in the general stress response and stationary-phase transition in the bacteria that encode them. Contrary to this widely accepted view, we show an additional housekeeping function of σ that complements the function of σ in logarithmically growing cells. These findings implicate a novel and dynamic partnership between σ and σ in maintaining the expression of housekeeping genes in mycobacteria and can perhaps be extended to other bacterial species that possess multiple group II sigma factors."

However, little is known about the utilization of the alternative nitrogen source ethanolamine. Our study revealed that  can utilize ethanolamine as a sole nitrogen or carbon (/) source, although it grows poorly on this nitrogen source due to the absence of a specific ethanolamine permease. Heterologous expression of a putative ethanolamine permease (SPRI_5940) from  positively influenced the biomass accumulation of the overexpression strain grown in defined medium with ethanolamine. In this study, we demonstrated that a glutamine synthetase-like protein, GlnA4 (SCO1613), is involved in the initial metabolic step of a novel ethanolamine utilization pathway in  M145. GlnA4 acts as a gamma-glutamylethanolamide synthetase. Transcriptional analysis revealed that expression of  was induced by ethanolamine and repressed in the presence of ammonium. Regulation of  is governed by the transcriptional repressor EpuRI (SCO1614). The  mutant strain was unable to grow on defined liquid Evans medium supplemented with ethanolamine. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis demonstrated that strain  is unable to utilize ethanolamine. GlnA4-catalyzed glutamylation of ethanolamine was confirmed in an enzymatic  assay, and the GlnA4 reaction product, gamma-glutamylethanolamide, was detected by HPLC/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS). In this work, the first step of ethanolamine utilization in  M145 was elucidated, and a putative ethanolamine utilization pathway was deduced based on the sequence similarity and genomic localization of homologous genes. Until now, knowledge of the utilization of ethanolamine in  was limited. Our work represents the first attempt to reveal a novel ethanolamine utilization pathway in the actinobacterial model organism  through the characterization of the key enzyme gamma-glutamylethanolamide synthetase GlnA4, which is absolutely required for growth in the presence of ethanolamine. The novel ethanolamine utilization pathway is dissimilar to the currently known ethanolamine utilization pathway, which occurs in metabolome. The novel ethanolamine utilization pathway does not result in the production of toxic by-products (such as acetaldehyde); thus, it is not encapsulated. We believe that this contribution is a milestone in understanding the ecology of  and the utilization of alternative nitrogen sources. Our report provides new insight into bacterial primary metabolism, which remains complex and partially unexplored."

            "#text": "Flagellin (Hag) is one of the most abundant proteins in  Here we show that each flagellar filament is assembled from ∼12,000 Hag monomers and that there is a cytoplasmic pool of Hag that is restricted to 5% of the total. Hag is thought to be restricted at the level of translation by a partner-switching mechanism involving FliW and the homodimeric RNA-binding protein CsrA (CsrA). We further show that the mechanism of translation inhibition is hypersensitive due to a 1:1 ratio of Hag to FliW, a 1:1 inhibitory ratio of FliW to CsrA, and a nearly 1:1 ratio of CsrA to  transcripts. Equimolarity of all components couples single-molecule detection of Hag export to compensatory translation and causes cytoplasmic Hag concentrations to oscillate around the level of FliW. We found that stoichiometry is ensured by genetic architecture, translational coupling, and the ability of CsrA to restrict  transcript accumulation. We further show that homeostasis prevents Hag hyperaccumulation that would otherwise cause severe defects in intracellular architecture, perhaps due to increased molecular crowding. We note that FliW-CsrA-mediated structural homeostasis has similarities to that seen with some toxin-antitoxin systems. The intracellular concentration of flagellar filament protein Hag is restricted by the Hag-FliW-CsrA system in  Here we show that the Hag-FliW-CsrA system functions at nearly 1:1:1 stoichiometry and that the system is both robust with respect to perturbation and hypersensitive to the Hag intracellular concentration. Moreover, restriction of cytoplasmic Hag levels is important for maintaining proper intracellular architecture, as artificial Hag hyperaccumulation led to generalized spatial defects and a high frequency of minicell production. The Hag-FliW-CsrA system is conserved in the deeper branches of bacterial phylogeny, and we note that the Hag-FliW-CsrA \"homeostasis module\" resembles a toxin-antitoxin system where, by analogy, CsrA is the \"toxin,\" FliW is the \"antitoxin,\" and Hag is the target."

            "#text": "The biosynthesis of the unique cyanobacterial (oxyphotobacterial) indole-phenolic UVA sunscreen, scytonemin, is coded for in a conserved operon that contains both core metabolic genes and accessory, aromatic amino acid biosynthesis genes dedicated to supplying scytonemin's precursors. Comparative genomics shows conservation of this operon in many, but not all, cyanobacterial lineages. Phylogenetic analyses of the operon's aromatic amino acid genes indicate that five of them were recruited into the operon after duplication events of their respective housekeeping cyanobacterial cognates. We combined the fossil record of cyanobacteria and relaxed molecular clock models to obtain multiple estimates of these duplication events, setting a minimum age for the evolutionary advent of scytonemin at 2.1 ± 0.3 billion years. The same analyses were used to estimate the advent of cyanobacteria as a group (and thus the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis), at 3.6 ± 0.2 billion years before present.  interpretation of 16S rRNA-based Bayesian analyses was consistent with these estimates. Because of physiological constraints on the use of UVA sunscreens in general, and the biochemical constraints of scytonemin in particular, scytonemin's age must postdate the time when Earth's atmosphere turned oxic, known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). Indeed, our biological estimate is in agreement with independent geochemical estimates for the GOE. The difference between the estimated ages of oxygenic photosynthesis and the GOE indicates the long span (on the order of a billion years) of the era of \"oxygen oases,\" when oxygen was available locally but not globally. The advent of cyanobacteria, with their invention of oxygenic photosynthesis, and the Great Oxidation Event are arguably among the most important events in the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Oxygen is a significant toxicant to all life, but its accumulation in the atmosphere also enabled the successful development and proliferation of many aerobic organisms, especially metazoans. The currently favored dating of the Great Oxidation Event is based on the geochemical rock record. Similarly, the advent of cyanobacteria is also often drawn from the same estimates because in older rocks paleontological evidence is scarce or has been discredited. Efforts to obtain molecular evolutionary alternatives have offered widely divergent estimates. Our analyses provide a novel means to circumvent these limitations and allow us to estimate the large time gap between the two events."

            "#text": "Bacterial host cell invasion mechanisms depend on the bacterium's virulence factors and the properties of the target cell. The enteropathogen  serovar Typhimurium (Tm) invades epithelial cell types in the gut mucosa and a variety of immune cell types at later infection stages. The molecular mechanism(s) of host cell entry has, however, been studied predominantly in epithelial cell lines. Tm uses a type three secretion system (TTSS-1) to translocate effectors into the host cell cytosol, thereby sparking actin ruffle-dependent entry. The ruffles also fuel cooperative invasion by bystander bacteria. In addition, several TTSS-1-independent entry mechanisms exist, involving alternative Tm virulence factors, or the passive uptake of bacteria by phagocytosis. However, it remains ill-defined how Tm invasion mechanisms vary between host cells. Here, we developed an internally controlled and scalable method to map Tm invasion mechanisms across host cell types and conditions. The method relies on host cell infections with consortia of chromosomally tagged wild-type and mutant Tm strains, where the abundance of each strain can be quantified by qPCR or amplicon sequencing. Using this methodology, we quantified cooccurring TTSS-1-dependent, cooperative, and TTSS-1-independent invasion events in epithelial, monocyte, and macrophage cells. We found Tm invasion of epithelial cells and monocytes to proceed by a similar MOI-dependent mix of TTSS-1-dependent and cooperative mechanisms. TTSS-1-independent entry was more frequent in macrophages. Still, TTSS-1-dependent invasion dominated during the first minutes of interaction also with this cell type. Finally, the combined action of the SopB/SopE/SopE2 effectors was sufficient to explain TTSS-1-dependent invasion across both epithelial and phagocytic cells. serovar Typhimurium (Tm) is a widespread and broad-host-spectrum enteropathogen with the capacity to invade diverse cell types. Still, the molecular basis for the host cell invasion process has largely been inferred from studies of a few selected cell lines. Our work resolves the mechanisms that  employ to invade prototypical host cell types, i.e., human epithelial, monocyte, and macrophage cells, at a previously unattainable level of temporal and quantitative precision. This highlights efficient bacterium-driven entry into innate immune cells and uncovers a type III secretion system effector module that dominates active bacterial invasion of not only epithelial cells but also monocytes and macrophages. The results are derived from a generalizable method, where we combine barcoding of the bacterial chromosome with mixed consortium infections of cultured host cells. The application of this methodology across bacterial species and infection models will provide a scalable means to address host-pathogen interactions in diverse contexts."

            "#text": "The biomineralization pathway of magnetite in magnetotactic bacteria is still poorly understood and a matter of intense debates. In particular, the existence, nature, and location of possible mineral precursors of magnetite are not clear. One possible precursor has been suggested to be ferritin-bound ferrihydrite. To clarify its role for magnetite biomineralization, we analyzed and characterized ferritin-like proteins from the magnetotactic alphaproteobacterium  MSR-1, employing genetic, biochemical, and spectroscopic techniques. Transmission Mössbauer spectroscopy of the wild type (WT) and a bacterioferritin () deletion strain uncovered that the presence of ferrihydrite in cells is coupled to the presence of Bfr.

Thus, ferritin-like proteins are not involved in magnetite biomineralization and Bfr-bound ferrihydrite is not a precursor of magnetite biosynthesis. Using transmission electron microscopy and bacterial two-hybrid and electrophoretic methods, we also show that MSR-1 Bfr is an atypical representative of the Bfr subfamily, as it forms tetraeicosameric complexes from two distinct subunits. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that these subunits are functionally divergent, with Bfr1 harboring a ferroxidase activity while only Bfr2 contributes to heme binding. Because of this functional differentiation and the poor formation of homooligomeric Bfr1 complexes, only heterooligomeric Bfr protects cells from oxidative stress  In summary, our results not only provide novel insights into the biomineralization of magnetite but also reveal the unique properties of so-far-uncharacterized heterooligomeric bacterioferritins. Magnetotactic bacteria like  are able to orient along magnetic field lines due to the intracellular formation of magnetite nanoparticles. Biomineralization of magnetite has been suggested to require a yet-unknown ferritin-like ferrihydrite component. Here, we report the identification of a bacterioferritin as the source of ferrihydrite in  and show that, contrary to previous reports, bacterioferritin is not involved in magnetite biomineralization but required for oxidative stress resistance. Additionally, we show that bacterioferritin of  is an unusual member of the bacterioferritin subfamily as it is composed of two functionally distinct subunits. Thus, our findings extend our understanding of the bacterioferritin subfamily and also solve a longstanding question about the magnetite biomineralization pathway."

            "#text": "Division ring formation at midcell is controlled by various mechanisms in , one of them being the linkage between the chromosomal Ter macrodomain and the Z-ring mediated by MatP, a DNA binding protein that organizes this macrodomain and contributes to the prevention of premature chromosome segregation. Here we show that, during cell division, just before splitting the daughter cells, MatP seems to localize close to the cytoplasmic membrane, suggesting that this protein might interact with lipids. To test this hypothesis, we investigated MatP interaction with lipids  We found that, when encapsulated inside vesicles and microdroplets generated by microfluidics, MatP accumulates at phospholipid bilayers and monolayers matching the lipid composition in the  inner membrane. MatP binding to lipids was independently confirmed using lipid-coated microbeads and biolayer interferometry assays, which suggested that the recognition is mainly hydrophobic. Interaction of MatP with the lipid membranes also occurs in the presence of the DNA sequences specifically targeted by the protein, but there is no evidence of ternary membrane/protein/DNA complexes. We propose that the association of MatP with lipids may modulate its spatiotemporal localization and its recognition of other ligands. The division of an  cell into two daughter cells with equal genomic information and similar size requires duplication and segregation of the chromosome and subsequent scission of the envelope by a protein ring, the Z-ring. MatP is a DNA binding protein that contributes both to the positioning of the Z-ring at midcell and the temporal control of nucleoid segregation. Our integrated  and  analysis provides evidence that MatP can interact with lipid membranes reproducing the phospholipid mixture in the  inner membrane, without concomitant recruitment of the short DNA sequences specifically targeted by MatP. This observation strongly suggests that the membrane may play a role in the regulation of the function and localization of MatP, which could be relevant for the coordination of the two fundamental processes in which this protein participates, nucleoid segregation and cell division."

Here, we have generated an engineered three-dimensional (3D) human brain endothelial microvessel model and studied  binding under the large range of physiological flow velocities that occur in both health and disease. Perfusion assays on 3D microvessels reveal previously unappreciated phenotypic heterogeneity in parasite binding to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-activated brain endothelial cells. While clonal parasite lines expressing a group B  erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) present an increase in binding to activated 3D microvessels, IE expressing DC8-PfEMP1 present a decrease in binding. The differential response to endothelium activation is mediated by surface expression changes of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). These findings demonstrate heterogeneity in parasite binding and provide evidence for a parasite strategy to adapt to a changing microvascular environment during infection. The engineered 3D human brain microvessel model provides new mechanistic insight into parasite binding and opens opportunities for further studies on malaria pathogenesis and parasite-vessel interactions. Cerebral malaria research has been hindered by the inaccessibility of the brain. Here, we have developed an engineered 3D human brain microvessel model that mimics the blood flow rates and architecture of small blood vessels to study how infected human erythrocytes attach to brain endothelial cells. By studying parasite lines with different adhesive properties, we show that the malaria parasite binding rate is heterogeneous and strongly influenced by physiological differences in flow and whether the endothelium has been previously activated by TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine that is linked to malaria disease severity. We also show the importance of human EPCR and ICAM-1 in parasite binding. Our model sheds new light on how  binds within brain microvessels and provides a powerful method for future investigations of recruitment of human brain pathogens to the blood vessel lining of the brain."

            "#text": "Prokaryotes represent an ancestral lineage in the tree of life and constitute optimal resources for investigating the evolution of genomes in unicellular organisms. Many bacterial species possess multipartite genomes offering opportunities to study functional variations among replicons, how and where new genes integrate into a genome, and how genetic information within a lineage becomes encoded and evolves. To analyze these issues, we focused on the model soil bacterium , which harbors a chromosome, a chromid (pSymB), a megaplasmid (pSymA), and, in many strains, one or more accessory plasmids. The analysis of several genomes, together with 1.4 Mb of accessory plasmid DNA that we purified and sequenced, revealed clearly different functional profiles associated with each genomic entity. pSymA, in particular, exhibited remarkable interstrain variation and a high density of singletons (unique, exclusive genes) featuring functionalities and modal codon usages that were very similar to those of the plasmidome. All this evidence reinforces the idea of a close relationship between pSymA and the plasmidome. Correspondence analyses revealed that adaptation of codon usages to the translational machinery increased from plasmidome to pSymA to pSymB to chromosome, corresponding as such to the ancestry of each replicon in the lineage. We demonstrated that chromosomal core genes gradually adapted to the translational machinery, reminiscent of observations in several bacterial taxa for genes with high expression levels. Such findings indicate a previously undiscovered codon usage adaptation associated with the chromosomal core information that likely operates to improve bacterial fitness. We present a comprehensive model illustrating the central findings described here, discussed in the context of the changes occurring during the evolution of a multipartite prokaryote genome. Bacterial genomes usually include many thousands of genes which are expressed with diverse spatial-temporal patterns and intensities. A well-known evidence is that highly expressed genes, such as the ribosomal and other translation-related proteins (RTRPs), have accommodated their codon usage to optimize translation efficiency and accuracy. Using a bioinformatic approach, we identify core-genes sets with different ancestries, and demonstrate that selection processes that optimize codon usage are not restricted to RTRPs but extended at a genome-wide scale. Such findings highlight, for the first time, a previously undiscovered adaptation strategy associated with the chromosomal-core information. Contrasted with the translationally more adapted genes, singletons (i.e., exclusive genes, including those of the plasmidome) appear as the gene pool with the less-ameliorated codon usage in the lineage. A comprehensive summary describing the inter- and intra-replicon heterogeneity of codon usages in a complex prokaryote genome is presented."

Importantly, we identify and characterize the conserved  gene encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that is necessary for the metabolic utilization of BaP in  We further demonstrate that the fungal NF-κB-type  regulators VeA and VelB are required for proper expression of  in response to nutrient limitation and BaP degradation in  Our study illuminates fundamental knowledge of fungal BaP metabolism and provides novel insights into enhancing bioremediation potential. We are increasingly exposed to environmental pollutants, including the carcinogen benzo[]pyrene (BaP), which has prompted extensive research into human metabolism of toxicants. However, little is known about metabolic mechanisms employed by fungi that are able to use some toxic pollutants as the substrates for growth, leaving innocuous by-products. This study systemically demonstrates that a common soil-dwelling fungus is able to use benzo[]pyrene as food, which results in expression and metabolic changes associated with growth and energy generation. Importantly, this study reveals key components of the metabolic utilization of BaP, notably a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and the fungal NF-κB-type transcriptional regulators. Our study advances fundamental knowledge of fungal BaP metabolism and provides novel insight into designing and implementing enhanced bioremediation strategies."

            "#text": "Ebola virus (EBOV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes Ebola virus disease (EVD), characterized by excessive inflammation, lymphocyte apoptosis, hemorrhage, and coagulation defects leading to multiorgan failure and shock. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-EBOV), which is highly efficacious against lethal challenge in nonhuman primates, is the only vaccine that successfully completed a phase III clinical trial. Additional studies showed VSV-EBOV provides complete and partial protection to macaques immunized 7 and 3 days before EBOV challenge, respectively. However, the mechanisms by which this live-attenuated vaccine elicits rapid protection are only partially understood. To address this, we carried out a longitudinal transcriptome analysis of host responses in whole-blood samples collected from cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with VSV-EBOV 28, 21, 14, 7, and 3 days before EBOV challenge. Our findings indicate the transcriptional response to the vaccine peaks 7 days following vaccination and contains signatures of both innate antiviral immunity as well as B-cell activation. EBOV challenge 1 week after vaccination resulted in large gene expression changes suggestive of a recall adaptive immune response 14 days postchallenge. Lastly, the timing and magnitude of innate immunity and interferon-stimulated gene expression correlated with viral burden and disease outcome in animals vaccinated 3 days before challenge. Ebola virus (EBOV) is the causative agent of Ebola virus disease (EVD), a deadly disease and major public health threat worldwide. A safe and highly efficacious vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine against EBOV is the only platform that has successfully completed phase III clinical trials and has been used in recent and ongoing outbreaks. Earlier studies showed that antibodies are the main mode of protection when this vaccine is administered 28 days before EBOV challenge. Recently, we showed this vaccine can provide protection when administered as early as 3 days before challenge and before antibodies are detected. This study seeks to identify the mechanisms of rapid protection, which in turn will pave the way for improved vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, this study provides insight into host gene expression signatures that could provide early biomarkers to identify infected individuals who are at highest risk of poor outcomes."

These lipoproteins are essential components in each of the molecular machines that build the OM, including the Bam machine that assembles β-barrel proteins and the Lpt pathway that transports lipopolysaccharide. Stress responses are known to monitor Bam and Lpt function, yet no stress system has been found that oversees the fundamental process of lipoprotein trafficking. We used genetic and chemical biology approaches to induce several different lipoprotein trafficking stresses in  Our results identified the Cpx two-component system as a stress response for monitoring trafficking. Cpx is activated by trafficking defects and is required to protect the cell against the consequence of the resulting stress. The OM-targeted lipoprotein NlpE acts as a sensor that allows Cpx to gauge trafficking efficiency. We reveal that NlpE signals to Cpx while it is transiting the inner membrane (IM)  to the OM and that only a small highly conserved N-terminal domain is required for signaling. We propose that defective trafficking causes NlpE to accumulate in the IM, activating Cpx to mount a transcriptional response that protects cells. Furthermore, we reconcile this new role of NlpE in signaling trafficking defects with its previously proposed role in sensing copper (Cu) stress by demonstrating that Cu impairs acylation of lipoproteins and, consequently, their trafficking to the OM. The outer membrane built by Gram-negative bacteria such as  forms a barrier that prevents antibiotics from entering the cell, limiting clinical options at a time of prevalent antibiotic resistance. Stress responses ensure that barrier integrity is continuously maintained. We have identified the Cpx signal transduction system as a stress response that monitors the trafficking of lipid-anchored lipoproteins to the outer membrane. These lipoproteins are needed by every machine that builds the outer membrane. Cpx monitors just one lipoprotein, NlpE, to detect the efficiency of lipoprotein trafficking in the cell. NlpE and Cpx were previously shown to play a role in resistance to copper. We show that copper blocks lipoprotein trafficking, reconciling old and new observations. Copper is an important element in innate immunity against pathogens, and our findings suggest that NlpE and Cpx help  survive the assault of copper on a key outer membrane assembly pathway."

To understand how  EC1 can protect itself from the antimicrobial activity of zeamines, we tested whether the ABC transporter genes within the  (zeamine synthesis) gene cluster were related to zeamine resistance. Our results ruled out the possible involvement of these ABC transporters in zeamine resistance and instead unveiled an RND (resistance-nodulation-cell division) efflux pump, DesABC, which plays an important role in zeamine resistance in  EC1. The  genes are located next to the  gene cluster, but  is at a distant location in the bacterial genome. Null mutation of the  genes in a zeamine-minus derivative of strain EC1 led to about an 8- to 32-fold decrease in zeamine tolerance level. This efflux pump was zeamine specific and appeared to be conserved only in  species, which may explain the high potency of zeamines against a wide range of bacterial pathogens. Significantly, expression of the  genes was abolished by deletion of , which encodes zeamine biosynthesis but could be induced by exogenous addition of zeamines. The results suggest that sophisticated and coordinated regulatory mechanisms have evolved to govern zeamine production and tolerance. Taken together, these findings documented a novel signaling role of zeamines and the first resistance mechanism against zeamines, which is a family of potent and promising antibiotics against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Zeamines are a family of newly identified phytotoxins and potent antibiotics produced by  EC1. Unlike most bacterial organisms, which are highly sensitive,  EC1 is tolerant to zeamines, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. Our study showed, for the first time, that a new RND efflux pump, DesABC, is indispensable for  EC1 against zeamines. We found that the DesABC efflux pump was zeamine specific and appeared to be conserved only in the  species, which may explain the high potency of zeamines against a wide range of bacterial pathogens. We also showed that expression of DesABC efflux system genes was induced by zeamines. These findings not only provide an answer to why  EC1 is much more tolerant to zeamines than other bacterial pathogens but also document a signaling role of zeamines in modulation of gene expression."

During systemic infection of host trees, pathogen cells must rapidly respond to changes in their environment as they move through different host tissues that present distinct challenges and sources of nutrition. Growing evidence indicates that small RNAs (sRNAs) play an important role in disease progression as posttranscriptional regulators. The sRNA ArcZ positively regulates the motility phenotype and transcription of flagellar genes in  Ea1189 yet is a direct repressor of translation of the flagellar master regulator, FlhD. We utilized transposon mutagenesis to conduct a forward genetic screen and identified suppressor mutations that increase motility in the Ea1189 mutant background. This enabled us to determine that the mechanism of transcriptional activation of the  mRNA by ArcZ is mediated by the leucine-responsive regulatory protein, Lrp. We show that Lrp contributes to expression of virulence and several virulence-associated traits, including production of the exopolysaccharide amylovoran, levansucrase activity, and biofilm formation. We further show that Lrp is regulated posttranscriptionally by ArcZ through destabilization of  mRNA. Thus, ArcZ regulation of FlhDC directly and indirectly through Lrp forms an incoherent feed-forward loop that regulates levansucrase activity and motility as outputs. This work identifies Lrp as a novel participant in virulence regulation in  and places it in the context of a virulence-associated regulatory network. Fire blight disease continues to plague the commercial production of apples and pears despite more than a century of research into disease epidemiology and disease control. The causative agent of fire blight,  coordinates turning on or off specific virulence-associated traits at the appropriate time during disease development. The development of novel control strategies requires an in-depth understanding of  regulatory mechanisms, including regulatory control of virulence-associated traits. This study investigates how the small RNA ArcZ regulates motility at the transcriptional level and identifies the transcription factor Lrp as a novel participant in the regulation of several virulence-associated traits. We report that ArcZ and Lrp together affect key virulence-associated traits through integration of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Further understanding of the topology of virulence regulatory networks can uncover weak points that can subsequently be exploited to control ."

            "#text": "The exact cause of neurocognitive dysfunction in HIV-positive patients despite successful control of the infection in the periphery is not completely understood. One suggested mechanism is a vicious cycle of microglial activation and release of proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines that eventually leads to neuronal loss and dysfunction. However, the exact role of microglial activation in the earliest stages of the infection with high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral loads (VL) is unclear. In this study, we imaged the translocator protein (TSPO), a mitochondrial membrane receptor known to be upregulated in activated microglia and macrophages, in rhesus macaques before and multiple times after inoculation with a neurotropic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strain (SIVsm804E), using 18F-DPA714 positron emission tomography (PET). The whole-brain standardized uptake values of TSPO at equilibrium reflecting total binding (SUV) and binding potentials (BP) were calculated and correlated with CSF and serum markers of disease, and a corresponding postmortem immunostaining analysis was also performed. SUV was found to be inversely correlated with both CSF VL and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) levels. In SIV-infected macaques with very high CSF VL at necropsy (>10 copies/ml), we found decreased TSPO binding by PET, and this was supported by immunostaining which showed glial and neuronal apoptosis rather than microglial activation. On the other hand, with only moderately elevated CSF VL (∼10 copies/ml), we found increased TSPO binding as well as focal and diffuse microglial activation on immunostaining. Our results in the SIV-infected macaque model provide insights into the relationship between HIV neuropathology and CSF VL at various stages of the disease. Neurological and cognitive problems are a common complication of HIV infection and are prevalent even in treated individuals. Although the molecular processes underlying brain involvement with HIV are not completely understood, inflammation is suspected to play a significant role. Our work presents an  assessment of neuroinflammation in an animal model of HIV, the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaque. Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we identified changes in brain inflammation after inoculation with SIV over time. Interestingly, we found decreased binding of the PET ligand in the presence of very high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral loads. These findings were supported by immunostaining which showed marked glial loss instead of inflammation. This study provides insight into glial and neuronal changes associated with very high CSF viral load and could reflect similar changes occurring in HIV-infected patients."

Over the last decade, our group has studied, in depth, the pyrrolidine pathway of nicotine degradation in  S16. However, little is known regarding whole mechanism(s) regulating transcription of the nicotine degradation pathway gene cluster. In the present study, we comprehensively elucidate an overall view of the NicR2-mediated two-step mechanism regulating 3-succinoyl-pyridine (SP) biotransformation, which involves the association of free NicR2 with two promoters and the dissociation of NicR2 from the NicR2-promoter complex. NicR2 can bind to another promoter, , and regulate expression of the nicotine-degrading genes in the middle of  gene cluster, which are not controlled by the previously reported  promoter. We identified the function of the inverted repeat bases on the two promoters responsible for NicR2 binding and found out that the -35/-10 motif for RNA polymerase is overlapped by the NicR2 binding site. We clarify the exact role of 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine (HSP), which acts as an antagonist and may prevent binding of free NicR2 to the promoters but cannot release NicR2 from the promoters. Finally, a regulatory model is proposed, which consists of three parts: the interaction between NicR2 and two promoters ( and ), the interaction between NicR2 and two effectors (HSP and SP), and the interaction between NicR2 and RNA polymerase. We report the entire process underlying the NicR2 regulatory mechanism from association between free NicR2 and two promoters to dissociation of the NicR2-promoter complex. NicR2 can bind to another promoter, , which controls expression of nicotine-degrading genes that are not controlled by the  promoter. We identified specific nucleotides of the  promoter responsible for NicR2 binding. HSP was further demonstrated as an antagonist, which prevents the binding of NicR2 to the  and  promoters, by locking NicR2 in the derepression conformation. The competition between NicR2 and RNA polymerase is essential to initiate transcription of nicotine-degrading genes. This study extends our understanding of molecular mechanisms in biodegradation of environmental pollutants and toxicants."

            "#text": "is a leading cause of invasive fungal infections. Resistance to first-line triazole antifungals has led to therapy with echinocandin drugs. Recently, we identified several high-minimum-effective-concentration (MEC)  clinical isolates from patients failing echinocandin therapy. Echinocandin resistance is known to arise from amino acid substitutions in β-(1,3)-d-glucan synthase encoded by the  gene. Yet these clinical isolates did not contain mutations in , indicating an undefined resistance mechanism. To explore this new mechanism, we used a laboratory-derived strain, RG101, with a nearly identical caspofungin (CAS) susceptibility phenotype that also does not contain  mutations. Glucan synthase isolated from RG101 was fully sensitive to echinocandins. Yet exposure of RG101 to CAS during growth yielded a modified enzyme that was drug insensitive (4 log orders) in kinetic inhibition assays, and this insensitivity was also observed for enzymes isolated from clinical isolates. To understand this alteration, we analyzed whole-enzyme posttranslational modifications (PTMs) but found none linked to resistance. However, analysis of the lipid microenvironment of the enzyme with resistance induced by CAS revealed a prominent increase in the abundances of dihydrosphingosine (DhSph) and phytosphingosine (PhSph). Exogenous addition of DhSph and PhSph to the sensitive enzyme recapitulated the drug insensitivity of the CAS-derived enzyme. Further analysis demonstrated that CAS induces mitochondrion-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that dampening ROS formation by antimycin A or thiourea eliminated drug-induced resistance. We conclude that CAS induces cellular stress, promoting formation of ROS and triggering an alteration in the composition of plasma membrane lipids surrounding glucan synthase, rendering it insensitive to echinocandins. Resistance to first-line triazole antifungal agents among  species has prompted the use of second-line therapy with echinocandins. As the number of -infected patients treated with echinocandins is rising, clinical observations of drug resistance are also increasing, indicating an emerging global health threat. Our knowledge regarding the development of clinical echinocandin resistance is largely derived from  spp., while little is known about resistance in  Therefore, it is important to understand the specific cellular responses raised by  against echinocandins. We discovered a new mechanism of resistance in  that is independent of the well-characterized  mutation mechanism observed in  This study identified an off-target effect of CAS, i.e., ROS production, and integrated oxidative stress and sphingolipid alterations into a novel mechanism of resistance. This stress-induced response has implications for drug resistance and/or tolerance mechanisms in other fungal pathogens."

            "#text": "The origin of novel genes and beneficial functions is of fundamental interest in evolutionary biology. New genes can originate from different mechanisms, including horizontal gene transfer, duplication-divergence, and  from noncoding DNA sequences. Comparative genomics has generated strong evidence for  emergence of genes in various organisms, but experimental demonstration of this process has been limited to localized randomization in preexisting structural scaffolds. This bypasses the basic requirement of  gene emergence, i.e., lack of an ancestral gene. We constructed highly diverse plasmid libraries encoding randomly generated open reading frames and expressed them in  to identify short peptides that could confer a beneficial and selectable phenotype  (in a living cell). Selections on antibiotic-containing agar plates resulted in the identification of three peptides that increased aminoglycoside resistance up to 48-fold. Combining genetic and functional analyses, we show that the peptides are highly hydrophobic, and by inserting into the membrane, they reduce membrane potential, decrease aminoglycoside uptake, and thereby confer high-level resistance. This study demonstrates that randomized DNA sequences can encode peptides that confer selective benefits and illustrates how expression of random sequences could spark the origination of new genes. In addition, our results also show that this question can be addressed experimentally by expression of highly diverse sequence libraries and subsequent selection for specific functions, such as resistance to toxic compounds, the ability to rescue auxotrophic/temperature-sensitive mutants, and growth on normally nonused carbon sources, allowing the exploration of many different phenotypes. gene origination from nonfunctional DNA sequences was long assumed to be implausible. However, recent studies have shown that large fractions of genomic noncoding DNA are transcribed and translated, potentially generating new genes. Experimental validation of this process so far has been limited to comparative genomics,  selections, or partial randomizations. Here, we describe selection of novel peptides  using fully random synthetic expression libraries. The peptides confer aminoglycoside resistance by inserting into the bacterial membrane and thereby partly reducing membrane potential and decreasing drug uptake. Our results show that beneficial peptides can be selected from random sequence pools  and support the idea that expression of noncoding sequences could spark the origination of new genes."

While the focus of much thought in the microbial pathogenesis and infectious diseases fields has been on the impact of host-microbe interaction on the host, here we ask questions about what happens to the microbe. What are the costs and benefits for microbes of having the capacity for virulence? Our exploration of this topic leads us to conclude that virulence confers very few benefits for microbes, unless disease is necessary for microbial survival through host-to-host spread. In fact, the capacity for virulence is often fraught with risk for microbes, including host dependence and the threat of extinction. The costs of virulence may explain why, relative to their enormous numbers in nature, very few microbes are actually associated with human and animal disease.",

            "#text": "Temperate phages encode an immunity system to control lytic gene expression during lysogeny. This gene regulatory circuit consists of multiple interacting genetic elements, and although it is essential for controlling phage growth, it is subject to conflicting evolutionary pressures. During superinfection of a lysogen, the prophage's circuit interacts with the superinfecting phage's circuit and prevents lytic growth if the two circuits are closely related. The circuitry is advantageous since it provides the prophage with a defense mechanism, but the circuitry is also disadvantageous since it limits the phage's host range during superinfection. Evolutionarily related phages have divergent, orthogonal immunity systems that no longer interact and are heteroimmune, but we do not understand how immunity systems evolve new specificities. Here, we use a group of Cluster A mycobacteriophages that exhibit a spectrum of genetic diversity to examine how immunity system evolution impacts superinfection immunity. We show that phages with mesotypic (i.e., genetically related but distinct) immunity systems exhibit asymmetric and incomplete superinfection phenotypes. They form complex immunity networks instead of well-defined immunity groups, and mutations conferring escape (i.e., virulence) from homotypic or mesotypic immunity have various escape specificities. Thus, virulence and the evolution of new immune specificities are shaped by interactions with homotypic and mesotypic immunity systems. Many aspects regarding superinfection, immunity, virulence, and the evolution of immune specificities are poorly understood due to the lack of large collections of isolated and sequenced phages with a spectrum of genetic diversity. Using a genetically diverse collection of Cluster A phages, we show that the classical and relatively straightforward patterns of homoimmunity, heteroimmunity, and virulence result from interactions between homotypic and heterotypic phages at the extreme edges of an evolutionary continuum of immune specificities. Genetic interactions between mesotypic phages result in more complex mesoimmunity phenotypes and virulence profiles. These results highlight that the evolution of immune specificities can be shaped by homotypic and mesotypic interactions and may be more dynamic than previously considered."

            "#text": "The factors that determine host susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) are poorly defined. The microbiota has been identified as a key influence on the nutritional, metabolic, and immunological status of the host, although its role in the pathogenesis of TB is currently unclear. Here, we investigated the influence of  exposure on the microbiome and conversely the impact of the intestinal microbiome on the outcome of  exposure in a rhesus macaque model of tuberculosis. Animals were infected with different strains and doses of  in three independent experiments, resulting in a range of disease severities. The compositions of the microbiotas were then assessed using a combination of 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing in fecal samples collected pre- and postinfection. Clustering analyses of the microbiota compositions revealed that alterations in the microbiome after  infection were of much lower magnitude than the variability seen between individual monkeys. However, the microbiomes of macaques that developed severe disease were noticeably distinct from those of the animals with less severe disease as well as from each other. In particular, the bacterial families  and  were enriched in monkeys that were more susceptible to infection, while numbers of  were decreased. These findings in infected nonhuman primates reveal that certain baseline microbiome communities may strongly associate with the development of severe tuberculosis following infection and can be more important disease correlates than alterations to the microbiota following  infection itself. Why some but not all individuals infected with  develop disease is poorly understood. Previous studies have revealed an important influence of the microbiota on host resistance to infection with a number of different disease agents. Here, we investigated the possible role of the individual's microbiome in impacting the outcome of  infection in rhesus monkeys experimentally exposed to this important human pathogen. Although  infection itself caused only minor alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in these animals, we observed a significant correlation between an individual monkey's microbiome and the severity of pulmonary disease. More importantly, this correlation between microbiota structure and disease outcome was evident even prior to infection. Taken together, our findings suggest that the composition of the microbiome may be a useful predictor of tuberculosis progression in infected individuals either directly because of the microbiome's direct influence on host resistance or indirectly because of its association with other host factors that have this influence. This calls for exploration of the potential of the microbiota composition as a predictive biomarker through carefully designed prospective studies."

The gut microbiota coordinates behaviors by sensing host- or microbiota-derived signals. Here we show for the first time that microbiota-derived indole is highly prevalent in the lumen compared to the intestinal tissue. This difference in indole concentration plays a key role in modulating virulence gene expression of the enteric pathogens enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) and  Indole decreases expression of genes within the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, which is essential for these pathogens to form attaching and effacing (AE) lesions on enterocytes. We synthetically altered the concentration of indole in the GI tracts of mice by employing mice treated with antibiotics to deplete the microbiota and reconstituted with indole-producing commensal  () or a  Δ mutant (does not produce indole) or by engineering an indole-producing  strain. This allowed us to assess the role of self-produced versus microbiota-produced indole, and the results show that decreased indole concentrations promote bacterial pathogenesis, while increased levels of indole decrease bacterial virulence gene expression. Moreover, we identified the bacterial membrane-bound histidine sensor kinase (HK) CpxA as an indole sensor. Enteric pathogens sense a gradient of indole concentrations in the gut to probe different niches and successfully establish an infection. Pathogens sense and respond to several small molecules within the GI tract to modulate expression of their virulence repertoire. Indole is a signaling molecule produced by the gut microbiota. Here we show that indole concentrations are higher in the lumen, where the microbiota is present, than in the intestinal tissue. The enteric pathogens EHEC and  sense indole to downregulate expression of their virulence genes, as a read-out of the luminal compartment. We also identified the bacterial membrane-bound HK CpxA as an indole sensor. This regulation ensures that EHEC and  express their virulence genes only at the epithelial lining, which is the niche they colonize."

Exported proteins must cross the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) and the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) encasing the parasite to access the host cell. Crossing the PVM requires protein unfolding and passage through a translocon, the  translocon of exported proteins (PTEX). In this study, we provide the first direct evidence that heat shock protein 101 (HSP101), a core component of PTEX, unfolds proteins for translocation across the PVM by creating transgenic  parasites in which the unfoldase and translocation functions of HSP101 have become uncoupled. Strikingly, while these parasites could export native proteins, they were unable to translocate soluble, tightly folded reporter proteins bearing the  export element (PEXEL) across the PVM into host erythrocytes under the same conditions. In contrast, an identical PEXEL reporter protein but harboring a transmembrane domain could be exported, suggesting that a prior unfolding step occurs at the PPM. Together, these results demonstrate that the export of parasite proteins is dependent on how these proteins are presented to the secretory pathway before they reach PTEX as well as their folded status. Accordingly, only tightly folded soluble proteins secreted into the vacuolar space and not proteins containing transmembrane domains or the majority of erythrocyte-stage exported proteins have an absolute requirement for the full unfoldase activity of HSP101 to be exported. The  parasites that cause malaria export hundreds of proteins into their host red blood cell (RBC). These exported proteins drastically alter the structural and functional properties of the RBC and play critical roles in parasite virulence and survival. To access the RBC cytoplasm, parasite proteins must pass through the  translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) located at the membrane interfacing the parasite and host cell. Our data provide evidence that HSP101, a component of PTEX, serves to unfold protein cargo requiring translocation. We also reveal that addition of a transmembrane domain to soluble cargo influences its ability to be translocated by parasites in which the HSP101 motor and unfolding activities have become uncoupled. Therefore, we propose that proteins with transmembrane domains use an alternative unfolding pathway prior to PTEX to facilitate export."

It is associated with type IV pili, and specialized competence pili mediate DNA uptake. Here, we show that the crystal structure of a competence-associated protein from , ComZ, consists of a type II secretion pseudopilin-like domain, with a large β-solenoid domain inserted into the β-sheet of the pilin-like fold. ComZ binds with high affinity to another competence-associated pilin, PilA2, which lies adjacent to the  gene in the genome. The crystal structure of PilA2 revealed a similar type II secretion pseudopilin-like fold, with a small subdomain; docking simulations predicted that PilA2 binds between the pseudopilin-like and β-solenoid domains of ComZ. Electrophoretic shift analysis and DNase protection studies were used to show that ComZ alone and the ComZ/PilA2 complex are able to bind DNA. Protection against reductive dimethylation was used in combination with mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis to identify two lysine residues in ComZ which are involved in DNA binding. They are located between the two domains in ComZ, on the opposite side from the predicted PilA2 binding site. These results suggest a model in which PilA2 assists ComZ in forming the competence pilus tip and DNA binds to the side of the fiber. The results demonstrate how a type IV pilin can be adapted to a specific function by domain insertion and provide the first structural insights into a tip-located competence pilin. is a thermophilic bacterium which is capable of natural transformation, the uptake of external DNA with high efficiency. DNA uptake is thought to be mediated by a competence-associated pilus, which binds the DNA substrate and mediates its transfer across the outer membrane and periplasm. Here, we describe the structural and functional analysis of two pilins which are known to be essential for DNA uptake, ComZ and PilA2. ComZ adopts an unusual structure, incorporating a large β-solenoid domain into the pilin structural framework. We argue on structural grounds that this structure cannot readily be accommodated into the competence pilus fiber unless it is at the tip. We also show that ComZ binds DNA and identify two lysine residues which appear to be important for DNA binding. These results suggest a model in which ComZ and PilA2 form a tip-associated DNA receptor which mediates DNA uptake."

Previous studies have shown that  uses glucose and glutamine as the main carbon sources to support asexual reproduction, but neither nutrient is essential. Such metabolic flexibility may allow it to survive within diverse host cell types. Here, by focusing on the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PYK) that converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate, we found that  can also utilize lactate and alanine. We show that catabolism of all indicated carbon sources converges at pyruvate, and maintaining a constant pyruvate supply is critical to parasite growth.  expresses two PYKs: PYK1 in the cytosol and PYK2 in the apicoplast (a chloroplast relict). Genetic deletion of  did not noticeably affect parasite growth and virulence, which contrasts with the current model of carbon metabolism in the apicoplast. On the other hand,  was refractory to disruption. Conditional depletion of PYK1 resulted in global alteration of carbon metabolism, amylopectin accumulation, and reduced cellular ATP, leading to severe growth impairment. Notably, the attenuated growth of the PYK1-depleted mutant was partially rescued by lactate or alanine supplementation, and rescue by lactate required lactate dehydrogenase activity to convert it to pyruvate. Moreover, depletion of PYK1 in conjunction with PYK2 ablation led to accentuated loss of apicoplasts and complete growth arrest. Together, our results underline a critical role of pyruvate homeostasis in determining the metabolic flexibility and apicoplast maintenance, and they significantly extend our current understanding of carbon metabolism in  infects almost all warm-blooded animals, and metabolic flexibility is deemed critical for its successful parasitism in diverse hosts. Glucose and glutamine are the major carbon sources to support parasite growth. In this study, we found that  is also competent in utilizing lactate and alanine and, thus, exhibits exceptional metabolic versatility. Notably, all these nutrients need to be converted to pyruvate to fuel the lytic cycle, and achieving a continued pyruvate supply is vital to parasite survival and metabolic flexibility. Although pyruvate can be generated by two distinct pyruvate kinases, located in cytosol and apicoplast, respectively, the cytosolic enzyme is the main source of subcellular pyruvate, and cooperative usage of pyruvate among multiple organelles is critical for parasite growth and virulence. These findings expand our current understanding of carbon metabolism in  and related parasites while providing a basis for designing novel antiparasitic interventions."

Despite growing interest in this organism as a potential therapeutic, many of its genes remain uncharacterized. Here, we perform a high-throughput genetic screen with  using transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) to explore the genetic requirements of predation. Two hundred one genes were deemed essential for growth in the absence of prey, whereas over 100 genes were found to be specifically required for predative growth on the human pathogens  and  in both planktonic and biofilm states. To further this work, we created an ordered-knockout library in  and developed new high-throughput techniques to characterize the mutants by their stage of deficiency in the predator life cycle. Using microscopy and flow cytometry, we confirmed 10 mutants defective in prey attachment and eight mutants defective in prey rounding. The majority of these genes are hypothetical and previously uncharacterized. Finally, we propose new nomenclature to group  mutants into classes based on their stage of predation defect. These results contribute to our basic understanding of bacterial predation and may be useful for harnessing  to kill harmful pathogens in the clinical setting. is a predatory bacterium that can kill a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, including many human pathogens. Given the global rise of antibiotic resistance and dearth of new antibiotics discovered in the past 30 years, this predator has potential as an alternative to traditional antibiotics. For many years,  research was hampered by a lack of genetic tools, and the genetic mechanisms of predation have only recently begun to be established. Here, we comprehensively identify and characterize predator genes required for killing bacterial prey, as well as genes that interfere in this process, which may allow us to design better therapeutic predators. Based on our study, we and other researchers may ultimately be able to genetically engineer strains that have improved killing rates, target specific species of prey, or preferentially target prey in the planktonic or biofilm state."

            "#text": "Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are widespread mobile DNA within bacterial genomes, whose lifestyle is relatively poorly understood. ICEs transmit vertically through donor cell chromosome replication, but in order to transfer, they have to excise from the chromosome. The excision step makes ICEs prone to loss, in case the donor cell divides and the ICE is not replicated. By adapting the system of LacI-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) binding to  operator arrays, we analyze here the process of excision and transfer of the ICE for 3-chlorobenzoate degradation (ICE) in individual cells of the bacterium  We provide evidence that ICE excises exclusively in a subset of specialized transfer-competent cells. ICE copy numbers in transfer-competent cells were higher than in regular nontransferring cells but were reduced in mutants lacking the ICE  origin of transfer, the ICE DNA relaxase, or the excision recombination sites. Consistently, transfer-competent cells showed a higher proportion without any observable LacI-CFP foci, suggesting ICE loss, but this proportion was independent of the ICE relaxase or the ICE origins of transfer. Our results thus indicated that the excised ICE becomes transiently replicated in transfer-competent cells, with up to six observable copies from LacI-CFP fluorescent focus measurements. Most of the observed ICE transfer to ICE-free  recipients occurred from donors displaying 3 to 4 ICE copies, which constitute a minority among all transfer-competent cells. This finding suggests, therefore, that replication of the excised ICE in donors is beneficial for transfer fitness to recipient cells. Bacterial evolution is driven to a large extent by horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-the processes that distribute genetic material between species rather than by vertical descent. The different elements and processes mediating HGT have been characterized in great molecular detail. In contrast, very little is known on adaptive features selecting HGT evolvability and fitness optimization. By studying the molecular behavior of an integrated mobile DNA of the class of integrative and conjugative elements in individual  donor bacteria, we report here how transient replication of the element after its excision from the chromosome is favorable for its transfer success. Since successful transfer into a new recipient is a measure of the element's fitness, transient replication may have been selected as an adaptive benefit for more-optimal transfer."

The yeast Elg1 RFC-like complex (RLC) is the principal unloader of chromatin-bound PCNA and thus plays a central role in maintaining genome stability. Here we identify a role for Elg1 in the unloading of PCNA during DNA damage. Using DNA damage checkpoint (DC)-inducible and replication checkpoint (RC)-inducible strains, we show that Elg1 is essential for eliciting the signal in the DC branch. In the absence of Elg1 activity, the Rad9 (53BP1) and Dpb11 (TopBP1) adaptor proteins are recruited but fail to be phosphorylated by Mec1 (ATR), resulting in a lack of checkpoint activation. The chromatin immunoprecipitation of PCNA at the Lac operator sites reveals that accumulated local PCNA influences the checkpoint activation process in  mutants. Our data suggest that Elg1 participates in a mechanism that may coordinate PCNA unloading during DNA repair with DNA damage checkpoint induction. The Elg1protein forms an RFC-like complex in charge of unloading PCNA from chromatin during DNA replication and repair. Mutations in the  gene caused genomic instability in all organisms tested and cancer in mammals. Here we show that Elg1 plays a role in the induction of the DNA damage checkpoint, a cellular response to DNA damage. We show that this defect is due to a defect in the signal amplification process during induction. Thus, cells coordinate the cell's response and the PCNA unloading through the activity of Elg1."

We found that  LpxE structurally resembles YodM in , a phosphatase for phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) with a weak  activity on C-PP, and rescues  deficient in PGP and C-PP phosphatase activities; deletion of  in  reduces the MIC value of bacitracin, indicating a significant contribution of LpxE to the native bacterial C-PP phosphatase activity. Suppression of plasmid-borne  in  deficient in chromosomally encoded C-PP phosphatase activities results in cell enlargement, loss of O-antigen repeats of lipopolysaccharide, and ultimately cell death. These discoveries implicate LpxE as the first example of a multifunctional regulatory enzyme that orchestrates lipid A modification, O-antigen production, and peptidoglycan biogenesis to remodel multiple layers of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope. Dephosphorylation of the lipid A 1-phosphate by LpxE in Gram-negative bacteria plays important roles in antibiotic resistance, bacterial virulence, and modulation of the host immune system. Our results demonstrate that in addition to removing the 1-phosphate from lipid A, LpxEs also dephosphorylate undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, an important metabolite for the synthesis of the essential envelope components, peptidoglycan and O-antigen. Therefore, LpxEs participate in multiple layers of biogenesis of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope and increase antibiotic resistance. This discovery marks an important step toward understanding the regulation and biogenesis of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope."

            "#text": "The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cellular response system activated upon different types of stresses, including viral infection, to restore cellular homeostasis. However, many viruses manipulate this response for their own advantage. In this study, we investigated the association between murine norovirus (MNV) infection and the ISR and demonstrate that MNV regulates the ISR by activating and recruiting key ISR host factors. We observed that during MNV infection, there is a progressive increase in phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α), resulting in the suppression of host translation, and yet MNV translation still progresses under these conditions. Interestingly, the shutoff of host translation also impacts the translation of key signaling cytokines such as beta interferon, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Our subsequent analyses revealed that the phosphorylation of eIF2α was mediated via protein kinase R (PKR), but further investigation revealed that PKR activation, phosphorylation of eIF2α, and translational arrest were uncoupled during infection. We further observed that stress granules (SGs) are not induced during MNV infection and that MNV can restrict SG nucleation and formation. We observed that MNV recruited the key SG nucleating protein G3BP1 to its replication sites and intriguingly the silencing of G3BP1 negatively impacts MNV replication. Thus, it appears that MNV utilizes G3BP1 to enhance replication but equally to prevent SG formation, suggesting an anti-MNV property of SGs. Overall, this study highlights MNV manipulation of SGs, PKR, and translational control to regulate cytokine translation and to promote viral replication. Viruses hijack host machinery and regulate cellular homeostasis to actively replicate their genome, propagate, and cause disease. In retaliation, cells possess various defense mechanisms to detect, destroy, and clear infecting viruses, as well as signal to neighboring cells to inform them of the imminent threat. In this study, we demonstrate that the murine norovirus (MNV) infection stalls host protein translation and the production of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines. However, virus replication and protein translation still ensue. We show that MNV further prevents the formation of cytoplasmic RNA granules, called stress granules (SGs), by recruiting the key host protein G3BP1 to the MNV replication complex, a recruitment that is crucial to establishing and maintaining virus replication. Thus, MNV promotes immune evasion of the virus by altering protein translation. Together, this evasion strategy delays innate immune responses to MNV infection and accelerates disease onset."

            "#text": "Host-to-host transmission is a necessary but poorly understood aspect of microbial pathogenesis. Herein, we screened a genomic library of mutants of the leading respiratory pathogen  generated by mariner transposon mutagenesis (Tn-Seq) to identify genes contributing to its exit or shedding from the upper respiratory tract (URT), the limiting step in the organism's transmission in an infant mouse model. Our analysis focused on genes affecting the bacterial surface that directly impact interactions with the host. Among the multiple factors identified was the  locus, which adds d-alanine onto lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and thereby increases Toll-like receptor 2-mediated inflammation and resistance to antimicrobial peptides. The more robust proinflammatory response in the presence of d-alanylation promotes secretions that facilitate pneumococcal shedding and allows for transmission. Expression of the  locus is controlled by the CiaRH system, which senses cell wall stress in response to antimicrobial activity, including in response to lysozyme, the most abundant antimicrobial along the URT mucosa. Accordingly, in a  host, there was no longer an effect of the  locus on pneumococcal shedding. Thus, our findings demonstrate how a pathogen senses the URT milieu and then modifies its surface characteristics to take advantage of the host response for transit to another host. (the pneumococcus) is a common cause of respiratory tract and invasive infection. The overall effectiveness of immunization with the organism's capsular polysaccharide depends on its ability to block colonization of the upper respiratory tract and thereby prevent host-to-host transmission. Because of the limited coverage of current pneumococcal vaccines, we carried out an unbiased  transposon mutagenesis screen to identify pneumococcal factors other than its capsular polysaccharide that affect transmission. One such candidate was expressed by the  locus, previously shown to add d-alanine onto the pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid present on the bacterial cell surface. This modification protects against host antimicrobials and augments host inflammatory responses. The latter increases secretions and bacterial shedding from the upper respiratory tract to allow for transmission. Thus, this study provides insight into a mechanism employed by the pneumococcus to successfully transit from one host to another."

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the interactions between the fungal species  and the bacterial species  as they coexist in mixed-species biofilms. Specifically, the interactions of different  mutant strains deficient in filamentation (Δ/Δ and Δ/Δ), adhesive interactions (Δ/Δ and Δ/Δ), and production of matrix exopolymeric substances (EPS) (Δ/ΔΔ/Δ, Δ/Δ, and Δ/Δ) were evaluated with  under different conditions mimicking the environment in the oral cavity. Interestingly, our results revealed that growth of the biofilm-deficient  and  mutant strains in synthetic saliva or with  restored their biofilm-forming ability. Moreover, challenging previous observations indicating an important role of morphogenetic conversions in the interactions between these two species, our results indicated a highly synergistic interaction between  and the  filamentation-deficient  and  deletion mutants, which was particularly noticeable when the mixed biofilms were grown in synthetic saliva. Importantly, dual-species biofilms were found to exhibit increase in antimicrobial resistance, indicating that components of the fungal exopolymeric material confer protection to streptococcal cells against antibacterial treatment. Collectively, these findings unravel a high degree of complexity in the interactions between  and  in mixed-species biofilms, which may impact homeostasis in the oral cavity. Microbial communities have a great impact in health and disease.  interacts with multiple microorganisms in the oral cavity, frequently forming polymicrobial biofilms. We report on the synergistic interactions between  and the Gram-positive bacterium , for which we have examined the different contributions of adhesive interactions, filamentation, and the extracellular matrix to the formation of dual-species biofilms. Our results demonstrate that growth in the presence of the bacterium can restore the biofilm-forming ability of different  mutant strains with defects in adhesion and filamentation. The mixed-species biofilms also show high levels of resistance to antibacterial and antifungal antibiotics, and our results indicate that the fungal biofilm matrix protects bacterial cells within these mixed-species biofilms. Our observations add to a growing body of evidence indicating a high level of complexity in the reciprocal interactions and consortial behavior of fungal/bacterial biofilms."

            "#text": "Bacterial surface attachment is mediated by filamentous appendages called pili. Here, we describe the role of Tad pili during surface colonization of  Using an optical trap and microfluidic controlled flow conditions to mimic natural environments, we demonstrated that Tad pili undergo repeated dynamic cycles of extension and retraction. Within seconds after establishing surface contact, pilus retraction reorients cells into an upright position, promoting walking-like movements against the medium flow. Pilus-mediated positioning of the flagellate pole close to the surface facilitates motor-mediated mechanical sensing and promotes anchoring of the holdfast, an adhesive substance that affords long-term attachment. We present evidence that the second messenger c-di-GMP regulates pilus dynamics during surface encounter in distinct ways, promoting increased activity at intermediate levels and retraction of pili at peak concentrations. We propose a model in which flagellum and Tad pili functionally interact and together impose a ratchet-like mechanism that progressively drives  cells toward permanent surface attachment. Bacteria are able to colonize surfaces in environmental, industrial, and medical settings, where they form resilient communities called biofilms. In order to control bacterial surface colonization, microbiologists need to gain a detailed understanding of the processes that bacteria use to live at the liquid-surface interface and that allow them to adhere to and move on surfaces and eventually grow and persist on solid media. To facilitate these processes, bacteria are equipped with adhesive structures such as flagella and pili and with matrix components such as exopolysaccharides. How these cellular organelles are coordinated to optimize surface processes is currently subject to intense investigations. Here we used the model organism  to demonstrate that polar pili are highly dynamic structures that are functionally interconnected with the flagellar motor to mediate surface sensing, thereby enforcing rapid and permanent surface attachment. These studies provide an entry point for an in-depth molecular analysis of bacterial surface colonization."

            "#text": "Gene loss and genome reduction are defining characteristics of endosymbiotic bacteria. The most highly reduced endosymbiont genomes have lost numerous essential genes related to core cellular processes such as replication, transcription, and translation. Computational gene predictions performed for the genomes of the two bacterial symbionts of the cicada , \" Hodgkinia cicadicola\" () and \" Sulcia muelleri\" (), have found only 26 and 16 tRNA genes and 15 and 10 aminoacyl tRNA synthetase genes, respectively. Furthermore, the original \" Hodgkinia cicadicola\" genome annotation was missing several essential genes involved in tRNA processing, such as those encoding RNase P and CCA tRNA nucleotidyltransferase as well as several RNA editing enzymes required for tRNA maturation. How these cicada endosymbionts perform basic translation-related processes remains unknown. Here, by sequencing eukaryotic mRNAs and total small RNAs, we show that the limited tRNA set predicted by computational annotation of \" Sulcia muelleri\" and \" Hodgkinia cicadicola\" is likely correct. Furthermore, we show that despite the absence of genes encoding tRNA processing activities in the symbiont genomes, symbiont tRNAs have correctly processed 5' and 3' ends and seem to undergo nucleotide modification. Surprisingly, we found that most \" Hodgkinia cicadicola\" and \" Sulcia muelleri\" tRNAs exist as tRNA halves. We hypothesize that \" Sulcia muelleri\" and \" Hodgkinia cicadicola\" tRNAs function in bacterial translation but require host-encoded enzymes to do so. The smallest bacterial genomes, in the range of about 0.1 to 0.5 million base pairs, are commonly found in the nutritional endosymbionts of insects. These tiny genomes are missing genes that encode proteins and RNAs required for the translation of mRNAs, one of the most highly conserved and important cellular processes. In this study, we found that the bacterial endosymbionts of cicadas have genomes which encode incomplete tRNA sets and lack genes required for tRNA processing. Nevertheless, we found that endosymbiont tRNAs are correctly processed at their 5' and 3' ends and, surprisingly, that mostly exist as tRNA halves. We hypothesize that the cicada host must supply its symbionts with these missing tRNA processing activities."

Mitochondria have undergone many evolutionary changes, which include lineage-specific adaptations in association with their eukaryotic host. Seven lineage-specific genes required for electron transport chain function were identified in the CTG clade of fungi, of which  is a member. Additionally, examination of several highly diverged orthologs encoding mitochondrial proteins demonstrated functional reassignment for one of these. Deficits imparted by deletion of these genes revealed the critical role of respiration in virulence attributes of the fungus and highlight important evolutionary adaptations in  metabolism."

The analyses of the translocation, subcellular localization, and mode of action of T3SS effector proteins are of central importance for the understanding of host-pathogen interaction and pathogenesis of bacterial infections. The analysis of translocation requires dedicated techniques to address the temporal and spatial dynamics of translocation. Here we describe a novel approach to deploy self-labeling enzymes (SLE) as universal tags for localization and tracking of translocated effector proteins. Effector-SLE fusion proteins allow live-cell imaging of translocation by T3SS, superresolution microscopy, and single-molecule tracking of effector motility in living host cells. We describe the application of the approach to T3SS effector proteins for invasion and intracellular lifestyle of  serovar Typhimurium and to a T3SS effector of  The novel approach enables analyses of the role of T3SS in host-pathogen interaction at the highest temporal and spatial resolution, toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of their effector proteins. Type III secretion systems mediate translocation of effector proteins into mammalian cells. These proteins interfere with host cell functions, being main virulence factors of Gram-negative pathogens. Analyses of the process of translocation, the subcellular distribution, and the dynamics of effector proteins in host cells have been hampered by the lack of suitable tags and detection systems. Here we describe the use of self-labeling enzyme tags for generation of fusions with effector proteins that are translocated and functional in host cell manipulation. Self-labeling reactions with cell-permeable ligand dyes are possible prior to or after translocation. We applied the new approach to superresolution microscopy for effector protein translocation. For the first time, we show the dynamic properties of effector proteins in living host cells after translocation by intracellular bacteria. The new approach of self-labeling enzyme tags fusions will enable analyses of type III secretion system effector proteins with new dimensions of temporal and spatial resolution."

            "#text": "Chromosome segregation in sporulating  involves the tethering of sister chromosomes at opposite cell poles. RacA is known to mediate chromosome tethering by interacting with both centromere-like elements in the DNA and with DivIVA, a membrane protein which localizes to the cell poles. RacA has a secondary function in which it assists in nucleoid condensation. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to positioning and condensing the chromosome, RacA contributes to efficient transport of DNA by the chromosome segregation motor SpoIIIE. When RacA is deleted, one-quarter of cells fail to capture DNA in the nascent spore, yet 70% of cells fail to form viable spores without RacA. This discrepancy indicates that RacA possesses a role in sporulation beyond DNA capture and condensation. We observed that the mutant cells had reduced chromosome translocation into the forespore across the entire length of the chromosome, requiring nearly twice as much time to move a given DNA locus. Additionally, functional abolition of the RacA-DivIVA interaction reduced translocation to a similar degree as in a  deletion strain, demonstrating the importance of the RacA-mediated tether in translocation and chromosome packaging during sporulation. We propose that the DNA-membrane anchor facilitates efficient translocation by SpoIIIE, not through direct protein-protein contacts but by virtue of physical effects on the chromosome that arise from anchoring DNA at a distance. To properly segregate their chromosomes, organisms tightly regulate the organization and dynamics of their DNA. Aspects of the process by which DNA is translocated during sporulation are not yet fully understood, such as what factors indirectly influence the activity of the motor protein SpoIIIE. In this work, we have shown that a DNA-membrane tether mediated by RacA contributes to the activity of SpoIIIE. Loss of RacA nearly doubles the time of translocation, despite the physically distinct locations these proteins and their activities occupy within the cell. This is a rare example of an explicit effect that DNA-membrane connections can have on cell physiology and demonstrates that distant changes to the state of the chromosome can influence motor proteins which act upon it."

        "Abstract": "Outer membrane biogenesis is a complex process for Gram-negative bacteria as the components are synthesized in the cytoplasm or at the inner membrane and then transported to the outer membrane. Stress pathways monitor and respond to problems encountered in assembling the outer membrane. The two-component system CpxAR was recently reported to be a stress pathway for transport of lipoproteins to the outer membrane, but it was unclear how this stress is sensed. May et al. [K. L. May, K. M. Lehman, A. M. Mitchell, and M. Grabowicz, mBio 10(3):e00618-19, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00618-19] determined that an outer membrane lipoprotein, NlpE, is the sensor for lipoprotein biogenesis stress. The group demonstrated that CpxAR is activated by the N-terminal domain of NlpE when the lipoprotein accumulates at the inner membrane. Further, this work resolved a previously debated role for NlpE in sensing copper stress; copper was shown to inhibit acylation of lipoproteins, preventing them from being transported to the outer membrane.",

            "#text": "We developed a new approach that couples Southwestern blotting and mass spectrometry to discover proteins that bind extracellular DNA (eDNA) in bacterial biofilms. Using  as a model pathogen, we identified proteins with known DNA-binding activity and uncovered a series of lipoproteins with previously unrecognized DNA-binding activity. We demonstrated that expression of these lipoproteins results in an eDNA-dependent biofilm enhancement. Additionally, we found that while deletion of lipoproteins had a minimal impact on biofilm accumulation, these lipoprotein mutations increased biofilm porosity, suggesting that lipoproteins and their associated interactions contribute to biofilm structure. For one of the lipoproteins, SaeP, we showed that the biofilm phenotype requires the lipoprotein to be anchored to the outside of the cellular membrane, and we further showed that increased SaeP expression correlates with more retention of high-molecular-weight DNA on the bacterial cell surface. SaeP is a known auxiliary protein of the SaeRS system, and we also demonstrated that the levels of SaeP correlate with nuclease production, which can further impact biofilm development. It has been reported that  biofilms are stabilized by positively charged cytoplasmic proteins that are released into the extracellular environment, where they make favorable electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged cell surface and eDNA. In this work we extend this electrostatic net model to include secreted eDNA-binding proteins and membrane-attached lipoproteins that can function as anchor points between eDNA in the biofilm matrix and the bacterial cell surface. Many bacteria are capable of forming biofilms encased in a matrix of self-produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that protects them from chemotherapies and the host defenses. As a result of these inherent resistance mechanisms, bacterial biofilms are extremely difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic wounds, orthopedic and surgical wound infections, and invasive infections, such as infective endocarditis and osteomyelitis. It is therefore important to understand the nature of the interactions between the bacterial cell surface and EPS that stabilize biofilms. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) has been recognized as an EPS constituent for many bacterial species and has been shown to be important in promoting biofilm formation. Using  biofilms, we show that membrane-attached lipoproteins can interact with the eDNA in the biofilm matrix and promote biofilm formation, which suggests that lipoproteins are potential targets for novel therapies aimed at disrupting bacterial biofilms."

            "#text": "Preexisting immunity against dengue virus or West Nile virus was previously reported to mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in a mouse model. We show here that ZIKV-immune plasma samples from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals mediated ZIKV ADE of infection  and in mice. In a lethal infection model with a viral inoculum 10 times higher, both ADE and protection were observed, depending on the amount of infused immune plasma. In a vertical-transmission model, ZIKV-immune plasma infused to timed pregnant mice increased fetal demise and decreased the body weight of surviving fetuses. Depletion of IgG from an immune plasma abolished ADE of infection, and the presence of purified IgG alone mediated ADE of infection. Higher viral loads and proinflammatory cytokines were detected in mice treated with ZIKV-immune plasma samples compared to those receiving control plasma. Together, these data show that passive immunization with homotypic ZIKV antibodies, depending on the concentration, could either worsen or limit a subsequent ZIKV infection. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection is common to many viruses and is problematic when plasma antibody levels decline to subneutralizing concentrations. ADE of infection is especially important among flaviviruses, many of which are the cause of global health problems. Recently, human plasma samples immune to heterologous flaviviruses were shown to promote Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Here we showed in immunocompromised mouse models that homologous immune plasma samples protect mice from subsequent infection at high antibody concentrations but that they mediate ADE of infection and increase ZIKV pathogenesis in adult mice and fetal demise during pregnancy at low concentrations."

Using a synchronous culture of the unicellular red alga , we found that the levels of photosynthetic and respiratory activities peak during the morning and then decrease toward the evening and night, whereas the pathways for anaerobic consumption of pyruvate, produced by glycolysis, are upregulated during the evening and night as reported recently in the green alga  Inhibition of photosynthesis by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) largely reduced respiratory activity and the amplitude of the day/night rhythm of respiration, suggesting that the respiratory rhythm depends largely on photosynthetic activity. Even when the timing of G/S-phase transition was uncoupled from the day/night rhythm by depletion of retinoblastoma-related (RBR) protein, the same patterns of photosynthesis and respiration were observed, suggesting that cell cycle progression and energy metabolism are regulated independently. Progression of the S phase under conditions of photosynthesis elevated the frequency of nuclear DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). These results suggest that the temporal separation of oxygenic energy metabolism, which causes oxidative stress, from nuclear DNA replication reduces the risk of DSB during cell proliferation in  Eukaryotes acquired chloroplasts through an endosymbiotic event in which a cyanobacterium or a unicellular eukaryotic alga was integrated into a previously nonphotosynthetic eukaryotic cell. Photosynthesis by chloroplasts enabled algae to expand their habitats and led to further evolution of land plants. However, photosynthesis causes greater oxidative stress than mitochondrion-based respiration. In seed plants, cell division is restricted to nonphotosynthetic meristematic tissues and populations of photosynthetic cells expand without cell division. Thus, seemingly, photosynthesis is spatially sequestrated from cell proliferation. In contrast, eukaryotic algae possess photosynthetic chloroplasts throughout their life cycle. Here we show that oxygenic energy conversion (daytime) and nuclear DNA replication (night time) are temporally sequestrated in  This sequestration enables \"safe\" proliferation of cells and allows coexistence of chloroplasts and the eukaryotic host cell, as shown in yeast, where mitochondrial respiration and nuclear DNA replication are temporally sequestrated to reduce the mutation rate."

We collected subject metadata, including host physiological parameters, through standardized questionnaires and noninvasive biophysical methods. Using a combination of statistical modeling tools, we found that demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors collectively explained 12 to 20% of the variability in microbiome composition. The influence of health factors was strongest on the oral microbiome. Associations between host factors and the skin microbiome were generally dominated by operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with the  and  A subset of the correlations between microbial features and host attributes were site specific. To further explore the relationship between age and the skin microbiome of the forehead, we trained a Random Forest regression model to predict chronological age from microbial features. Age was associated mostly with two mutually coexcluding  OTUs. Furthermore, skin aging variables (wrinkles and hyperpigmented spots) were independently correlated to these taxa. Many studies have highlighted the importance of body site and individuality in shaping the composition of the human skin microbiome, but we still have a poor understanding of how extrinsic (e.g., lifestyle) and intrinsic (e.g., age) factors influence its composition. We characterized the bacterial microbiomes of North American volunteers at four skin sites and the mouth. We also collected extensive subject metadata and measured several host physiological parameters. Integration of host and microbial features showed that the skin microbiome was predominantly associated with demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors. Furthermore, we uncovered reproducible associations between chronological age, skin aging, and members of the genus  Our work provides new understanding of the role of host selection and lifestyle in shaping skin microbiome composition. It also contributes to a more comprehensive appreciation of the factors that drive interindividual skin microbiome variation."

In these low-metabolism states,  can tolerate antibiotics and develop genetically encoded antibiotic resistance, making its metabolic adaptation to stress crucial for survival. Numerous bacteria, including , have been shown to reduce their rates of mRNA degradation under growth limitation and stress. While the existence of this response appears to be conserved across species, the underlying bacterial mRNA stabilization mechanisms remain unknown. To better understand the biology of nongrowing mycobacteria, we sought to identify the mechanistic basis of mRNA stabilization in the nonpathogenic model  We found that mRNA half-life was responsive to energy stress, with carbon starvation and hypoxia causing global mRNA stabilization. This global stabilization was rapidly reversed when hypoxia-adapted cultures were reexposed to oxygen, even in the absence of new transcription. The stringent response and RNase levels did not explain mRNA stabilization, nor did transcript abundance. This led us to hypothesize that metabolic changes during growth cessation impact the activities of degradation proteins, increasing mRNA stability. Indeed, bedaquiline and isoniazid, two drugs with opposing effects on cellular energy status, had opposite effects on mRNA half-lives in growth-arrested cells. Taken together, our results indicate that mRNA stability in mycobacteria is not directly regulated by growth status but rather is dependent on the status of energy metabolism. The logistics of tuberculosis therapy are difficult, requiring multiple drugs for many months.  survives in part by entering nongrowing states in which it is metabolically less active and thus less susceptible to antibiotics. Basic knowledge on how  survives during these low-metabolism states is incomplete, and we hypothesize that optimized energy resource management is important. Here, we report that slowed mRNA turnover is a common feature of mycobacteria under energy stress but is not dependent on the mechanisms that have generally been postulated in the literature. Finally, we found that mRNA stability and growth status can be decoupled by a drug that causes growth arrest but increases metabolic activity, indicating that mRNA stability responds to metabolic status rather than to growth rate  Our findings suggest a need to reorient studies of global mRNA stabilization to identify novel mechanisms that are presumably responsible."

To function, Tsr forms trimers of homodimers (TODs), which associate  with the CheA kinase and CheW coupling protein. Together, these proteins assemble into extended hexagonal arrays. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography and molecular dynamics simulation to study Tsr in the context of a near-native array, characterizing its signaling-related conformational changes at both the individual dimer and the trimer level. In particular, we show that individual Tsr dimers within a trimer exhibit asymmetric flexibilities that are a function of the signaling state, highlighting the effect of their different protein interactions at the receptor tips. We further reveal that the dimer compactness of the Tsr trimer changes between signaling states, transitioning at the glycine hinge from a compact conformation in the kinase-OFF state to an expanded conformation in the kinase-ON state. Hence, our results support a crucial role for the glycine hinge: to allow the receptor flexibility necessary to achieve different signaling states while also maintaining structural constraints imposed by the membrane and extended array architecture. In , membrane-bound chemoreceptors, the histidine kinase CheA, and coupling protein CheW form highly ordered chemosensory arrays. In core signaling complexes, chemoreceptor trimers of dimers undergo conformational changes, induced by ligand binding and sensory adaptation, which regulate kinase activation. Here, we characterize by cryo-electron tomography the kinase-ON and kinase-OFF conformations of the  serine receptor in its native array context. We found distinctive structural differences between the members of a receptor trimer, which contact different partners in the signaling unit, and structural differences between the ON and OFF signaling complexes. Our results provide new insights into the signaling mechanism of chemoreceptor arrays and suggest an important functional role for a previously postulated flexible region and glycine hinge in the receptor molecule."

The experiments reported here demonstrated that, in , several interacting factors determine the wave. The origin is a major driver of BPS rates. When it is relocated, the BPS rates in a 1,000-kb region surrounding the new origin reproduce the pattern that surrounds the normal origin. However, the pattern across distant regions of the chromosome is unaltered and thus must be determined by other factors. Increasing the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) concentration shifts the wave pattern away from the origin, supporting the hypothesis that fluctuations in dNTP pools coincident with replication firing contribute to the variations in the mutation rate. The nucleoid binding proteins (HU and Fis) and the terminus organizing protein (MatP) are also major factors. These proteins alter the three-dimensional structure of the DNA, and results suggest that mutation rates increase when highly structured DNA is replicated. Biases in error correction by proofreading and mismatch repair, both of which may be responsive to dNTP concentrations and DNA structure, also are major determinants of the wave pattern. These factors should apply to most bacterial and, possibly, eukaryotic genomes and suggest that different areas of the genome evolve at different rates. It has been found in several species of bacteria that the rate at which single base pairs are mutated is not constant across the genome but varies in a wave-like pattern that is symmetrical about the origin of replication. Using  as our model system, we show that this pattern is the result of several interconnected factors. First, the timing and progression of replication are important in determining the wave pattern. Second, the three-dimensional structure of the DNA is also a factor, and the results suggest that mutation rates increase when highly structured DNA is replicated. Finally, biases in error correction, which may be responsive both to the progression of DNA synthesis and to DNA structure, are major determinants of the wave pattern. These factors should apply to most bacterial and, possibly, eukaryotic genomes and suggest that different areas of the genome evolve at different rates."

            "#text": "We have previously identified  mutants in which the stress response to subinhibitory concentrations of aminoglycoside is altered. One gene identified, VC1636, encodes a putative DNA/RNA helicase, recently named RadD in  Here we combined extensive genetic characterization and high-throughput approaches in order to identify partners and molecular mechanisms involving RadD. We show that double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are formed upon subinhibitory tobramycin treatment in the absence of  and  and that formation of these DSBs can be overcome by RNase H1 overexpression. Loss of RNase H1, or of the transcription-translation coupling factor EF-P, is lethal in the  deletion mutant. We propose that R-loops are formed upon sublethal aminoglycoside treatment, leading to the formation of DSBs that can be repaired by the RecBCD homologous recombination pathway, and that RadD counteracts such R-loop accumulation. We discuss how R-loops that can occur upon translation-transcription uncoupling could be the link between tobramycin treatment and DNA break formation. Bacteria frequently encounter low concentrations of antibiotics. Active antibiotics are commonly detected in soil and water at concentrations much below lethal concentration. Although sub-MICs of antibiotics do not kill bacteria, they can have a major impact on bacterial populations by contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance through mutations in originally sensitive bacteria or acquisition of DNA from resistant bacteria. It was shown that concentrations as low as 100-fold below the MIC can actually lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant cells. We seek to understand how bacterial cells react to such antibiotic concentrations using , the Gram-negative bacterial paradigm, and , the causative agent of cholera. Our findings shed light on the processes triggered at the DNA level by antibiotics targeting translation, how damage occurs, and what the bacterial strategies are to respond to such DNA damage."

Thus, HIV-1 Env-specific antibodies do not typically cross-react with the Env proteins of SIV isolates. Here we show that PGT145, a broadly neutralizing antibody to a quaternary epitope at the V2 apex of HIV-1 Env, directs the lysis of SIV-infected cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) but does not neutralize SIV infectivity. Amino acid substitutions in the V2 loop of SIV239 corresponding to the epitope for PGT145 in HIV-1 Env modulate sensitivity to this antibody. Whereas a substitution in a conserved N-linked glycosylation site (N171Q) eliminates sensitivity to ADCC, a lysine-to-serine substitution in this region (K180S) increases ADCC and renders the virus susceptible to neutralization. These differences in function correlate with an increase in the affinity of PGT145 binding to Env on the surface of virus-infected cells and to soluble Env trimers. To our knowledge, this represents the first instance of an HIV-1 Env-specific antibody that cross-reacts with SIV Env and illustrates how differences in antibody binding affinity for Env can differentiate sensitivity to ADCC from neutralization. Here we show that PGT145, a potent broadly neutralizing antibody to HIV-1, directs the lysis of SIV-infected cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity but does not neutralize SIV infectivity. This represents the first instance of cross-reactivity of an HIV-1 Env-specific antibody with SIV Env and reveals that antibody binding affinity can differentiate sensitivity to ADCC from neutralization."

            "#text": "Factors that contribute to enhanced susceptibility to severe bacterial disease after influenza virus infection are not well defined but likely include the microbiome of the respiratory tract. Vaccination against influenza, while having variable effectiveness, could also play a role in microbial community stability. We collected nasopharyngeal samples from 215 individuals infected with influenza A/H3N2 or influenza B virus and profiled the microbiota by target sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We identified signature taxonomic groups by performing linear discriminant analysis and effective size comparisons (LEfSe) and defined bacterial community types using Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) models. Influenza infection was shown to be significantly associated with microbial composition of the nasopharynx according to the virus type and the vaccination status of the patient. We identified four microbial community types across the combined cohort of influenza patients and healthy individuals with one community type most representative of the influenza virus-infected group. We also identified microbial taxa for which relative abundance was significantly higher in the unvaccinated elderly group; these taxa include species known to be associated with pneumonia. Our results suggest that there is a significant association between the composition of the microbiota in the nasopharynx and the influenza virus type causing the infection. We observe that vaccination status, especially in more senior individuals, also has an association with the microbial community profile. This indicates that vaccination against influenza, even when ineffective to prevent disease, could play a role in controlling secondary bacterial complications."

During the stringent response, the cell produces large quantities of the nucleotide alarmone ppGpp, which modulates many aspects of cell physiology, including reprogramming transcription, blocking protein translation, and inhibiting new rounds of DNA replication. The mechanism by which ppGpp inhibits DNA replication initiation in  remains unclear. Prior work suggested that ppGpp blocks new rounds of replication by inhibiting transcription of the essential initiation factor , but we found that replication is still inhibited by ppGpp in cells ectopically producing DnaA. Instead, we provide evidence that a global reduction of transcription by ppGpp prevents replication initiation by modulating the supercoiling state of the origin of replication,  Active transcription normally introduces negative supercoils into  to help promote replication initiation, so the accumulation of ppGpp reduces initiation potential at  by reducing transcription. We find that maintaining transcription near , either by expressing a ppGpp-blind RNA polymerase mutant or by inducing transcription from a ppGpp-insensitive promoter, can strongly bypass the inhibition of replication by ppGpp. Additionally, we show that increasing global negative supercoiling by inhibiting topoisomerase I or by deleting the nucleoid-associated protein gene  also relieves inhibition. We propose a model, potentially conserved across proteobacteria, in which ppGpp indirectly creates an unfavorable energy landscape for initiation by limiting the introduction of negative supercoils into  To survive bouts of starvation, cells must inhibit DNA replication. In bacteria, starvation triggers production of a signaling molecule called ppGpp (guanosine tetraphosphate) that helps reprogram cellular physiology, including inhibiting new rounds of DNA replication. While ppGpp has been known to block replication initiation in  for decades, the mechanism responsible was unknown. Early work suggested that ppGpp drives a decrease in levels of the replication initiator protein DnaA. However, we found that this decrease is not necessary to block replication initiation. Instead, we demonstrate that ppGpp leads to a change in DNA topology that prevents initiation. ppGpp is known to inhibit bulk transcription, which normally introduces negative supercoils into the chromosome, and negative supercoils near the origin of replication help drive its unwinding, leading to replication initiation. Thus, the accumulation of ppGpp prevents replication initiation by blocking the introduction of initiation-promoting negative supercoils. This mechanism is likely conserved throughout proteobacteria."

In general, environmental isolates of pathogenic species such as  var.  have reduced virulence relative to clinical isolates, despite having no differences in the expression of the canonical virulence traits (high-temperature growth, melanization, and capsule formation). In this observation, we report that environmental isolates of  tolerate host CO concentrations poorly compared to clinical isolates and that CO tolerance correlates well with the ability of the isolates to cause disease in mammals. Initial experiments also suggest that CO tolerance is particularly important for dissemination of  from the lung to the brain. Furthermore, CO concentrations affect the susceptibility of both clinical and environmental  isolates to the azole class of antifungal drugs, suggesting that antifungal testing in the presence of CO may improve the correlation between  azole activity and patient outcome. A number of studies comparing either patient outcomes or model system virulence across large collections of  isolates have found significant heterogeneity in virulence even among strains with highly related genotypes. Because this heterogeneity cannot be explained by variations in the three well-characterized virulence traits (growth at host body temperature, melanization, and polysaccharide capsule formation), it has been widely proposed that additional  virulence traits must exist. The natural niche of  is in the environment, where the carbon dioxide concentration is very low (∼0.04%); in contrast, mammalian host tissue carbon dioxide concentrations are 125-fold higher (5%). We have found that the ability to grow in the presence of 5% carbon dioxide distinguishes low-virulence strains from high-virulence strains, even those with a similar genotype.

            "#text": "Fatal outcomes following influenza infection are often associated with secondary bacterial infections. Allergic airway disease (AAD) is known to influence severe complications from respiratory infections, and yet the mechanistic effect of AAD on influenza virus- coinfection has not been investigated previously. We examined the impact of AAD on host susceptibility to viral-bacterial coinfections. We report that AAD improved survival during coinfection when viral-bacterial challenge occurred 1 week after AAD. Counterintuitively, mice with AAD had significantly deceased proinflammatory responses during infection. Specifically, both CD4 and CD8 T cell interferon gamma (IFN-γ) responses were suppressed following AAD. Resistance to coinfection was also associated with strong transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) expression and increased bacterial clearance. Treatment of AAD mice with IFN-γ or genetic deletion of TGF-β receptor II expression reversed the protective effects of AAD. Using a novel triple-challenge model system, we show for the first time that AAD can provide protection against influenza virus- coinfection through the production of TGF-β that suppresses the influenza virus-induced IFN-γ response, thereby preserving antibacterial immunity. Asthma has become one of the most common chronic diseases and has been identified as a risk factor for developing influenza. However, the impact of asthma on postinfluenza secondary bacterial infection is currently not known. Here, we developed a novel triple-challenge model of allergic airway disease, primary influenza infection, and secondary  infection to investigate the impact of asthma on susceptibility to viral-bacterial coinfections. We report for the first time that mice recovering from acute allergic airway disease are highly resistant to influenza-pneumococcal coinfection and that this resistance is due to inhibition of influenza virus-mediated impairment of bacterial clearance. Further characterization of allergic airway disease-associated resistance against postinfluenza secondary bacterial infection may aid in the development of prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment against coinfection."

            "#text": "Colonic bacterial populations are thought to have a role in the development of colorectal cancer with some protecting against inflammation and others exacerbating inflammation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and are produced in large quantities by colonic bacteria that produce SCFAs by fermenting fiber. We assessed whether there was an association between fecal SCFA concentrations and the presence of colonic adenomas or carcinomas in a cohort of individuals using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun sequence data. We measured the fecal concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate within the cohort and found that there were no significant associations between SCFA concentration and tumor status. When we incorporated these concentrations into random forest classification models trained to differentiate between people with healthy colons and those with adenomas or carcinomas, we found that they did not significantly improve the ability of 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence-based models to classify individuals. Finally, we generated random forest regression models trained to predict the concentration of each SCFA based on 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence data from the same samples. These models performed poorly and were able to explain at most 14% of the observed variation in the SCFA concentrations. These results support the broader epidemiological data that questions the value of fiber consumption for reducing the risks of colorectal cancer. Although other bacterial metabolites may serve as biomarkers to detect adenomas or carcinomas, fecal SCFA concentrations have limited predictive power. Considering that colorectal cancer is the third leading cancer-related cause of death within the United States, it is important to detect colorectal tumors early and to prevent the formation of tumors. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are often used as a surrogate for measuring gut health and for being anticarcinogenic because of their anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the fecal SCFA concentrations of a cohort of individuals with different colonic tumor burdens who were previously analyzed to identify microbiome-based biomarkers of tumors. We were unable to find an association between SCFA concentration and tumor burden or use SCFAs to improve our microbiome-based models of classifying people based on their tumor status. Furthermore, we were unable to find an association between the fecal community structure and SCFA concentrations. Our results indicate that the association between fecal SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and tumor burden is weak."

The Tat inhibitor didehydro-cortistatin A (dCA) promotes a state of persistent latency, refractory to viral reactivation. Here we investigated mechanisms of HIV-1 resistance to dCA  Mutations in Tat and TAR were not identified, consistent with the high level of conservation of these elements. Instead, viruses resistant to dCA developed higher Tat-independent basal transcription. We identified a combination of mutations in the HIV-1 promoter that increased basal transcriptional activity and modifications in viral Nef and Vpr proteins that increased NF-κB activity. Importantly, these variants are unlikely to enter latency due to accrued transcriptional fitness and loss of sensitivity to Tat feedback loop regulation. Furthermore, cells infected with these variants become more susceptible to cytopathic effects and immune-mediated clearance. This is the first report of viral escape to a Tat inhibitor resulting in heightened Tat-independent activity, all while maintaining wild-type Tat and TAR. HIV-1 Tat enhances viral RNA transcription by binding to TAR and recruiting activating factors. Tat enhances its own transcription via a positive-feedback loop. Didehydro-cortistatin A (dCA) is a potent Tat inhibitor, reducing HIV-1 transcription and preventing viral rebound. dCA activity demonstrates the potential of the \"block-and-lock\" functional cure approaches. We investigated the viral genetic barrier to dCA resistance  While mutations in Tat and TAR were not identified, mutations in the promoter and in the Nef and Vpr proteins promoted high Tat-independent activity. Promoter mutations increased the basal transcription, while Nef and Vpr mutations increased NF-κB nuclear translocation. This heightened transcriptional activity renders CD4 T cells infected with these viruses more susceptible to cytotoxic T cell-mediated killing and to cell death by cytopathic effects. Results provide insights on drug resistance to a novel class of antiretrovirals and reveal novel aspects of viral transcriptional regulation."

Horizontal gene transfer of resistance plasmids can complicate hospital outbreaks and cause problems in epidemiological tracing, since tracing is usually based on bacterial clonality. We have developed a method, based on optical DNA mapping combined with Cas9-assisted identification of resistance genes, which is used here to characterize plasmids during an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  outbreak at a Swedish neonatal intensive care unit. The outbreak included 17 neonates initially colonized with ESBL-producing  (ESBL-KP), some of which were found to carry additional ESBL-producing  (ESBL-EC) in follow-up samples. We demonstrate that all ESBL-KP isolates contained two plasmids with the  gene located on the smaller one (~80 kbp). The same ESBL-KP clone was present in follow-up samples for up to 2 years in some patients, and the plasmid carrying the  gene was stable throughout this time period. However, extensive genetic rearrangements within the second plasmid were observed in the optical DNA maps for several of the ESBL-KP isolates. Optical mapping also demonstrated that even though other bacterial clones and species carrying  group 1 genes were found in some neonates, no transfer of resistance plasmids had occurred. The data instead pointed toward unrelated acquisition of ESBL-producing  (EPE). In addition to revealing important information about the specific outbreak, the method presented is a promising tool for surveillance and infection control in clinical settings. This study presents how a novel method, based on visualizing single plasmids using sequence-specific fluorescent labeling, could be used to analyze the genetic dynamics of an outbreak of resistant bacteria in a neonatal intensive care unit at a Swedish hospital. Plasmids are a central reason for the rapid global spread of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. In a single experimental procedure, this method replaces many traditional plasmid analysis techniques that together provide limited details and are slow to perform. The method is much faster than long-read whole-genome sequencing and offers direct genetic comparison of patient samples. We could conclude that no transfer of resistance plasmids had occurred between different bacteria during the outbreak and that secondary cases of ESBL-producing  carriage were instead likely due to influx of new strains. We believe that the method offers potential in improving surveillance and infection control of resistant bacteria in hospitals."

The beneficial effect of microbes during malnutrition is dependent on their individual ability to proliferate in the fly environment and is mimicked by lifelong supplementation of equivalent levels of heat-killed microbes or dietary protein, suggesting that microbes can serve directly as a protein-rich food source. Here, we use nutritionally rich fly culture medium to demonstrate how changes in dietary composition influence monocolonized fly life span; microbes that extend fly life span on malnourishing diets can shorten life on rich diets. The mechanisms employed by microbes to affect host health likely differ on low- or high-nutrient diets. Our results demonstrate how -associated microbes can positively or negatively influence fly life span depending on the nutritional environment. Although controlled laboratory environments allow focused investigations on the interaction between fly microbiota and nutrition, the relevance of these studies is not straightforward, because it is difficult to mimic the nutritional ecology of natural -microbe interactions. As such, caution is needed in designing and interpreting fly-microbe experiments and before categorizing microbes into specific symbiotic roles based on results obtained from experiments testing limited conditions. ingests microorganisms growing within its rotting vegetation diet. Some of these microbes form associations with flies, while others pass through the gut with meals. Fly-microbe-diet interactions are dynamic, and changes to the fly culture medium can influence microbial growth in the overall environment. In turn, these alterations in microbial growth may not only impact the nutritional value of fly meals but also modulate behavior and health, at least in part due to direct contributions to fly nutrition. The interactive ecology between flies, microbes, and their environment can cause a specific microbe to be either beneficial or detrimental to fly life span, indicating that the environment should be considered a key influential factor in host-microbe interactions."

Phylogenies of the nucleotide and amino acid versions of this full data matrix as well as of several additional data matrices were generated using three different maximum likelihood schemes (i.e., gene-partitioned, unpartitioned, and coalescence) and using both site-homogenous and site-heterogeneous models (total of 64 species-level phylogenies). Examination of the topological agreement among these phylogenies and measures of internode certainty identified 11/78 (14.1%) bipartitions that were incongruent and pinpointed the likely underlying contributing factors, which included incomplete lineage sorting, hidden paralogy, hybridization or introgression, and reconstruction artifacts associated with poor taxon sampling. Relaxed molecular clock analyses suggest that  likely originated in the lower Cretaceous and that the  and  genera originated in the upper Cretaceous. Our results shed light on the ongoing debate on  systematics and taxonomy and provide a robust evolutionary and temporal framework for comparative genomic analyses in  More broadly, our approach provides a general template for phylogenomic identification of resolved and contentious branches in densely genome-sequenced lineages across the tree of life. Understanding the evolution of traits across technologically and medically significant fungi requires a robust phylogeny. Even though species in the  and  genera (family , class Eurotiomycetes) are some of the most significant technologically and medically relevant fungi, we still lack a genome-scale phylogeny of the lineage or knowledge of the parts of the phylogeny that exhibit conflict among analyses. Here, we used a phylogenomic approach to infer evolutionary relationships among 81 genomes that span the diversity of  and  species, to identify conflicts in the phylogeny, and to determine the likely underlying factors of the observed conflicts. Using a data matrix comprised of 1,668 genes, we found that while most branches of the phylogeny of the  are robustly supported and recovered irrespective of method of analysis, a few exhibit various degrees of conflict among our analyses. Further examination of the observed conflict revealed that it largely stems from incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization or introgression. Our analyses provide a robust and comprehensive evolutionary genomic roadmap for this important lineage, which will facilitate the examination of the diverse technologically and medically relevant traits of these fungi in an evolutionary context."

            "#text": "Damaged DNA typically imposes stringent controls on eukaryotic cell cycle progression, ensuring faithful transmission of genetic material. Some DNA breaks, and the resulting rearrangements, are advantageous, however. For example, antigenic variation in the parasitic African trypanosome, , relies upon homologous recombination-based rearrangements of telomeric variant surface glycoprotein () genes, triggered by breaks. Surprisingly, trypanosomes with a severed telomere continued to grow while progressively losing subtelomeric DNA, suggesting a nominal telomeric DNA damage checkpoint response. Here, we monitor the single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA) in response to induced, locus-specific DNA breaks in  RPA foci accumulated at nucleolar sites following a break within ribosomal DNA and at extranucleolar sites following a break elsewhere, including adjacent to transcribed or silent telomeric  gene As in other eukaryotes, RPA foci were formed in S phase and γH2A and RAD51 damage foci were disassembled prior to mitosis. Unlike in other eukaryotes, however, and regardless of the damaged locus, RPA foci persisted through the cell cycle, and these cells continued to replicate their DNA. We conclude that a DNA break, regardless of the damaged locus, fails to trigger a stringent cell cycle checkpoint in  This DNA damage tolerance may facilitate the generation of virulence-enhancing genetic diversity, within subtelomeric domains in particular. Stringent checkpoints may be similarly lacking in some other eukaryotic cells. Chromosome damage must be repaired to prevent the proliferation of defective cells. Alternatively, cells with damage must be eliminated. This is true of human and several other cell types but may not be the case for single-celled parasites, such as trypanosomes. African trypanosomes, which cause lethal diseases in both humans and livestock, can actually exploit chromosomal damage to activate new surface coat proteins and to evade host immune responses, for example. We monitored responses to single chromosomal breaks in trypanosomes using a DNA-binding protein that, in response to DNA damage, forms nuclear foci visible using a microscope. Surprisingly, and unlike what is seen in mammalian cells, these foci persist while cells continue to divide. We also demonstrate chromosome replication even when one chromosome is broken. These results reveal a remarkable degree of damage tolerance in trypanosomes, which may suit the lifestyle of a single-celled parasite, potentially facilitating adaptation and enhancing virulence."

Using glycan array analysis, we identified 247 specific interactions between  and glycans representative of those found on human cells. Interactions included those with mannosylated, fucosylated, and sialylated glycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and glycans terminating with galactose (Gal), -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), and -acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).

We identify gonococcal potential mannose-binding proteins and show that  uses mannosyl glycans expressed on the surface of cervical and urethral epithelia to facilitate adherence. Furthermore, a mannose-binding lectin or a mannoside compound was able to reduce this adherence.

            "#text": "Ebola virus (EBOV) causes highly lethal disease outbreaks against which no FDA-approved countermeasures are available. Although many host factors exploited by EBOV for cell entry have been identified, including host cell surface phosphatidylserine receptors, endosomal cysteine proteases, and the lysosomal cholesterol trafficking protein NPC1, key questions remain. Specifically, late entry steps culminating in viral membrane fusion remain enigmatic. Here, we investigated a set of glycoprotein (GP) mutants previously hypothesized to be entry defective and identified one mutation, R64A, that abolished infection with no apparent impact on GP expression, folding, or viral incorporation. R64A profoundly thermostabilized EBOV GP and rendered it highly resistant to proteolysis  Forward-genetics and cell entry studies strongly suggested that R64A's effects on GP thermostability and proteolysis arrest viral entry at least at two distinct steps: the first upstream of NPC1 binding and the second at a late entry step downstream of fusion activation. Concordantly, toremifene, a small-molecule entry inhibitor previously shown to bind and destabilize GP, may selectively enhance the infectivity of viral particles bearing GP(R64A) at subinhibitory concentrations. R64A provides a valuable tool to further define the interplay between GP stability, proteolysis, and viral membrane fusion; to explore the rational design of stability-modulating antivirals; and to spur the development of next-generation Ebola virus vaccines with improved stability. Ebola virus is a medically relevant virus responsible for outbreaks of severe disease in western and central Africa, with mortality rates reaching as high as 90%. Despite considerable effort, there are currently no FDA-approved therapeutics or targeted interventions available, highlighting the need of development in this area. Host-cell invasion represents an attractive target for antivirals, and several drug candidates have been identified; however, our limited understanding of the complex viral entry process challenges the development of such entry-targeting drugs. Here, we report on a glycoprotein mutation that abrogates viral entry and provides insights into the final steps of this process. In addition, the hyperstabilized phenotype of this mutant makes it useful as a tool in the discovery and design of stability-modulating antivirals and next-generation vaccines against Ebola virus."

            "#text": "Recent advances in unbiased pathogen discovery have implicated astroviruses as pathogens of the central nervous system (CNS) of mammals, including humans. However, the capacity of astroviruses to be cultured in CNS-derived cells  has not been reported to date. Both astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1; mamastrovirus 9) and classic human astrovirus 4 (HAstV4; mamastrovirus 1) have been previously detected from cases of human encephalitis. We tested the ability of primary human neurons, primary human astrocytes, and other immortalized human nervous system cell lines (SK-N-SH, U87 MG, and SW-1088) to support infection and replication of these two astrovirus genotypes. Primary astrocytes and SK-N-SH cells supported the full viral life cycle of VA1 with a >100-fold increase in viral RNA levels during a multistep growth curve, detection of viral capsid, and a >100-fold increase in viral titer. Primary astrocytes were permissive with respect to HAstV4 infection and replication but did not yield infectious virus, suggesting abortive infection. Similarly, abortive infection of VA1 was observed in SW-1088 and U87 MG cells. Elevated expression of the chemokine CXCL10 was detected in VA1-infected primary astrocytes and SK-N-SH cells, suggesting that VA1 infection can induce a proinflammatory host response. These findings establish an  cell culture model that is essential for investigation of the basic biology of astroviruses and their neuropathogenic potential. Encephalitis remains a diagnostic conundrum in humans as over 50% of cases are managed without the identification of an etiology. Astroviruses have been detected from the central nervous system of mammals in association with disease, suggesting that this family of RNA viruses could be responsible for cases of some neurological diseases that are currently without an ascribed etiology. However, there are significant barriers to understanding astrovirus infection as the capacity of these viruses to replicate in nervous system cells  has not been determined. We describe primary and immortalized cultured cells of the nervous system that support infection by astroviruses. These results further corroborate the role of astroviruses in causing neurological diseases and will serve as an essential model to interrogate the neuropathogenesis of astrovirus infection."

As evidence for phylosymbiosis rapidly accumulates in different vertebrate and invertebrate holobionts, a central question is what evolutionary forces cause this pattern. We use intra- and interspecific gut microbiota transplants to test for evidence of selective pressures that contribute to phylosymbiosis. We leverage three closely related species of the parasitoid wasp model  that recently diverged between 0.4 and 1 million years ago: , , and  Upon exposure of germfree larvae to heat-inactivated microbiota from intra- or interspecific larvae, we measure larval growth, pupation rate, and adult reproductive capacity. We report three key findings: (i) larval growth significantly slows when hosts receive an interspecific versus intraspecific gut microbiota, (ii) marked decreases in pupation and resulting adult survival occur from interspecific gut microbiota exposure, and (iii) adult reproductive capacities including male fertility and longevity are unaffected by early life exposure to an interspecific microbiota. Overall, these findings reveal developmental and survival costs to  upon larval exposures to interspecific microbiota and provide evidence that selective pressures on phenotypes produced by host-microbiota interactions may underpin phylosymbiosis. Phylosymbiosis is an ecoevolutionary hypothesis and emerging pattern in animal-microbiota studies whereby the host phylogenetic relationships parallel the community relationships of the host-associated microbiota. A central prediction of phylosymbiosis is that closely related hosts exhibit a lower microbiota beta diversity than distantly related hosts. While phylosymbiosis has emerged as a widespread trend in a field often challenged to find trends across systems, two critical and understudied questions are whether or not phylosymbiosis is consequential to host biology and if adaptive evolutionary forces underpin the pattern. Here, using germfree rearing in the phylosymbiosis model , we demonstrate that early life exposure to heat-inactivated microbiota from more distantly related species poses more severe developmental and survival costs than microbiota from closely related or the same species. This study advances a functional understanding of the consequences and potential selective pressures underpinning phylosymbiosis."

However, two strains remained highly resistant, indicating that PmrA-mediated overexpression of the phosphoethanolamine (PetN) transferase PmrC is not the exclusive colistin resistance mechanism in  A detailed genetic characterization revealed a new colistin resistance mechanism mediated by genetic integration of the insertion element IS upstream of the PmrC homolog EptA (93% identity), leading to its overexpression. We found that  was ubiquitously present in clinical strains belonging to the international clone 2, and IS integration upstream of  was required to mediate the colistin-resistant phenotype. In addition, we found a duplicated IS- cassette in one isolate, indicating that this colistin resistance determinant may be embedded in a mobile genetic element. Our data disprove PmrA as a drug target for adjuvant therapy but highlight the importance of PetN transferase-mediated colistin resistance in clinical strains. We suggest that direct targeting of the homologous PetN transferases PmrC/EptA may have the potential to overcome colistin resistance in  The discovery of antibiotics revolutionized modern medicine and enabled us to cure previously deadly bacterial infections. However, a progressive increase in antibiotic resistance rates is a major and global threat for our health care system. Colistin represents one of our last-resort antibiotics that is still active against most Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, but increasing resistance is reported worldwide, in particular due to the plasmid-encoded protein MCR-1 present in pathogens such as  and  Here, we showed that colistin resistance in , a top-priority pathogen causing deadly nosocomial infections, is mediated through different avenues that result in increased activity of homologous phosphoethanolamine (PetN) transferases. Considering that MCR-1 is also a PetN transferase, our findings indicate that PetN transferases might be the Achilles heel of superbugs and that direct targeting of them may have the potential to preserve the activity of polymyxin antibiotics."

Here, we confirm that a CSCM also exists in the human colon and appears to be altered during colon cancer. The colonic microbiota is suggested to be involved in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Because the microbiota identified in fecal samples from CRC patients does not directly reflect the microbiota associated with tumor tissues themselves, we sought to characterize the bacterial communities from the crypts and associated adjacent mucosal surfaces of 58 patients (tumor and normal homologous tissue) and 9 controls with normal colonoscopy results. Here, we confirm that bacteria colonize human colonic crypts in both control and CRC tissues, and using laser-microdissected tissues and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we further show that right and left crypt- and mucosa-associated bacterial communities are significantly different. In addition to  and , and as with murine proximal colon crypts, environmental nonfermentative  are found in human colonic crypts.  and  are more abundant in right-side tumors, whereas  is more prevalent in left-side tumors. More precisely,  is more abundant in crypts from cancerous samples in the right colon than in associated nontumoral samples from adjacent areas but not in left-side colonic samples. Future analysis of the interaction between these bacteria and the crypt epithelium, particularly intestinal stem cells, will allow deciphering of their possible oncogenic potential. Due to the huge number of bacteria constituting the human colon microbiota, alteration in the balance of its constitutive taxa (i.e., dysbiosis) is highly suspected of being involved in colorectal oncogenesis. Indeed, bacterial signatures in association with CRC have been described. These signatures may vary if bacteria are identified in feces or in association with tumor tissues. Here, we show that bacteria colonize human colonic crypts in tissues obtained from patients with CRC and with normal colonoscopy results. Aerobic nonfermentative  previously identified as constitutive of the crypt-specific core microbiota in murine colonic samples are similarly prevalent in human colonic crypts in combination with other anaerobic taxa. We also show that bacterial signatures characterizing the crypts of colonic tumors vary depending whether right-side or left-side tumors are analyzed."

            "#text": "Clinical persistence of  () sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is a major public health concern.  persistence is known to develop through interferon gamma (IFN-γ) induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which catabolizes tryptophan, an essential amino acid for  replication. The organism can recover from persistence by synthesizing tryptophan from indole, a substrate for the enzyme tryptophan synthase. The majority of  strains, except for reference strain B/TW-5/OT, contain an operon comprised of α and β subunits that encode TrpA and TrpB, respectively, and form a functional αββα tetramer. However,  mutations in ocular  strains, which are responsible for the blinding eye disease known as trachoma, abrogate tryptophan synthesis from indole. We examined serial urogenital samples from a woman who had recurrent  infections over 4 years despite antibiotic treatment. The  isolates from each infection episode were genome sequenced and analyzed for phenotypic, structural, and functional characteristics. All isolates contained identical mutations in  and developed aberrant bodies within intracellular inclusions, visualized by transmission electron microscopy, even when supplemented with indole following IFN-γ treatment. Each isolate displayed an altered αββα structure, could not synthesize tryptophan from indole, and had significantly lower  expression but higher intracellular tryptophan levels compared with those of reference  strain F/IC-Cal3. Our data indicate that emergent mutations in the tryptophan operon, which were previously thought to be restricted only to ocular  strains, likely resulted in  persistence in the described patient and represents a novel host-pathogen adaptive strategy for survival. () is the most common sexually transmitted bacterium with more than 131 million cases occurring annually worldwide.  infections are often asymptomatic, persisting for many years despite treatment.  recovery from persistence occurs when indole is utilized by the organism's tryptophan synthase to synthesize tryptophan, an essential amino acid for replication. Ocular but not urogenital  strains contain mutations in the synthase that abrogate tryptophan synthesis. Here, we discovered that the genomes of serial isolates from a woman with recurrent, treated  STIs over many years were identical with a novel synthase mutation. This likely allowed long-term  persistence where active infection resumed only when tryptophan became available. Our findings indicate an emerging adaptive host-pathogen evolutionary strategy for survival in the urogenital tract that will prompt the field to further explore chlamydial persistence, evaluate the genetics of mutant  strains and fitness within the host, and their implications for disease pathogenesis."

            "#text": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection can result in a severe hemorrhagic syndrome for which there are no antiviral interventions available to date. Certain RNA viruses, such as CCHFV, encode cysteine proteases of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family that antagonize interferon (IFN) production by deconjugating ubiquitin (Ub). The OTU of CCHFV, a negative-strand RNA virus, is dispensable for replication of the viral genome, despite being part of the large viral RNA polymerase. Here, we show that mutations that prevent binding of the OTU to cellular ubiquitin are required for the generation of recombinant CCHFV containing a mutated catalytic cysteine. Similarly, the high-affinity binding of a synthetic ubiquitin variant (UbV-CC4) to CCHFV OTU strongly inhibits viral growth. UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV infection even in the absence of intact IFN signaling, suggesting that its antiviral activity is not due to blocking the OTU's immunosuppressive function. Instead, the prolonged occupancy of the OTU with UbV-CC4 directly targets viral replication by interfering with CCHFV RNA synthesis. Together, our data provide mechanistic details supporting the development of antivirals targeting viral OTUs. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is an important human pathogen with a wide global distribution for which no therapeutic interventions are available. CCHFV encodes a cysteine protease belonging to the ovarian tumor (OTU) family which is involved in host immune suppression. Here we demonstrate that artificially prolonged binding of the OTU to a substrate inhibits virus infection. This provides novel insights into CCHFV OTU function during the viral replicative cycle and highlights the OTU as a potential antiviral target."

Synthetic microbial communities provide reduced-complexity models that allow an examination of ecological theories under defined and controlled conditions. In this study, we applied a multiphasic approach to study synthetic methane-oxidizing communities and species interactions as proxies to the natural communities. Our results confirm that, under selective pressures, natural-sediment communities of high complexity simplify rapidly, selecting for several major functional guilds, the major partners in methane oxidation being the  methanotrophs and the  methylotrophs, along with minor but persistent partners, members of  and  As a proof of concept, we established minimalist synthetic communities that were representative of the four functional guilds to demonstrate the dependency of the non-methane-utilizing species on the methanotrophs as the primary carbon-providing species. We observed that in communities consisting of multiple representatives of the key guilds, members of the same guild appeared to compete for resources. For example, when two methanotrophs of the same family were present, the two expressed similar key methanotrophy pathways and responded similarly to changing environmental conditions, suggesting that they perform a similar keystone function  Similar observations were made for the  However, differences were noted in the expression of auxiliary and unique genes among strains of the same functional guild, reflecting differential adaptation and suggesting mechanisms for competition. At the same time, differences were also noted in the performances of partners with specific metabolic schemes. For example, a mutant of  impaired in nitrate utilization behaved as a more efficient cooperator in methane consumption, suggesting that the loss of function may lead to changes in communal behavior. Overall, we demonstrate the robust nature of synthetic communities built of native lake sediment strains and their utility in addressing important ecological questions while using a simplified model. The metabolism of methane is an important part of the global carbon cycle. While deciphering the community function and the potential role of the different functional guilds is very difficult when considering native complex communities, synthetic communities, built of species originating from a study site in question, present a simplified model and allow specific questions to be addressed as to carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrient transfer among species in a controlled system. This study applies an ecophysiological approach, as a proof of principle, to an already well-studied model system, contributing to a better understanding of microbial community function and microbial ecosystem processes."

CWD has been confirmed in at least 26 U.S. states, three Canadian provinces, South Korea, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, with a notable increase in the past 5 years. The continued geographic spread of this disease increases the frequency of exposure to CWD prions among cervids, humans, and other animal species. Since CWD is now an established wildlife disease in North America, proactive steps, where possible, should be taken to limit transmission of CWD among animals and reduce the potential for human exposure.",

We found that the  3880 (PA3880) gene, which encodes an unknown protein, acts as a regulator of anaerobic metabolism in response to oxidative stress and virulence in  More than 30 PA3880 homologs were found in other bacterial genomes, indicating that PA3880 is widely distributed in the  kingdom as a highly conserved gene. Deletion of the PA3880 gene changed the expression levels of more than 700 genes, including a group of virulence genes, under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. To further study the mechanisms of PA3880-mediated regulation in virulence, we utilized a bacterial two-hybrid assay and found that the PA3880 protein interacted directly with QS regulator MvfR and anaerobic regulator Anr. Loss of the PA3880 protein significantly blunted the pathogenicity of , resulting in increased host survival, decreased bacterial burdens, reduced inflammatory responses, and fewer lung injuries in challenged mice hosts. Mechanistically, we found that Cys44 was a critical site for the full function of PA3880 in influencing alveolar macrophage phagocytosis and bacterial clearance. We also found that AnvM directly interacted with host receptors Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR5, which might lead to activation of the host immune response. Hence, we gave the name AnvM (aerobic and irulence odulator) to the PA3880 protein. This characterization of AnvM could help to uncover new targets and strategies to treat  infections. Infections by , one of the most frequently isolated human pathogens, can create huge financial burdens. However, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of  remains elusive. We identified AnvM as a novel regulator of virulence in  Deletion of  altered the expression levels of more than 700 genes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, including quorum sensing system genes and oxidative stress resistance genes. AnvM directly interacted with MvfR and Anr, thus regulating their downstream genes. More importantly, AnvM directly bound to TLR2 and TLR5, which turn on the host immune response. These findings provide insights into the significance of AnvM homologs in pathogenic bacteria and suggest a potential drug target against bacterial infection."

In the case of infection with , the etiologic agent of brucellosis, the unfolded protein response in the infected placenta contributes to placentitis and abortion, leading to pathogen transmission. Here we show that  infection of pregnant mice led to death of infected placental trophoblasts in a manner that depended on the VirB type IV secretion system (T4SS) and its effector VceC. The trophoblast death program required the ER stress-induced transcription factor CHOP. While NOD1/NOD2 expression in macrophages contributed to ER stress-induced inflammation, these receptors did not play a role in trophoblast death. Both placentitis and abortion were independent of apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC). These studies show that  uses its T4SS to induce cell-type-specific responses to ER stress in trophoblasts that trigger placental inflammation and abortion. Our results suggest further that in  the T4SS and its effectors are under selection as bacterial transmission factors. infects the placenta of pregnant cows, where it replicates to high levels and triggers abortion of the calf. The aborted material is highly infectious and transmits infection to both cows and humans, but very little is known about how  causes abortion. By studying this infection in pregnant mice, we discovered that  kills trophoblasts, which are important cells for maintaining pregnancy. This killing required an injected bacterial protein (VceC) that triggered an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in the trophoblast. By inhibiting ER stress or infecting mice that lack CHOP, a protein induced by ER stress, we could prevent death of trophoblasts, reduce inflammation, and increase the viability of the pups. Our results suggest that  injects VceC into placental trophoblasts to promote its transmission by abortion."

In this study, we characterized long-term patterns of bacterial engraftment in a cohort of 18 patients, who received capsules from one of three donors, up to 409 days post-FMT. Bacterial communities were characterized using Illumina sequencing of the V5-V6 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, and engraftment was determined by using the Bayesian algorithm SourceTracker. All patients recovered clinically and were free of  infection following cFMT. The majority of patients (61%) showed high levels of engraftment after the first week following FMT, which were sustained throughout the year. A small subset, 22%, experienced a decline in donor engraftment after approximately 1 month, and a few patients (17%), two of whom were taking metformin, showed delayed and low levels of donor engraftment. Members of the genera , , and  were significantly and positively correlated with donor similarity (ρ = 0.237 to 0.373,  ≤ 0.017). Furthermore, throughout the year, patient fecal communities showed significant separation based on the donor fecal microbiota that they received ( < 0.001). Results of this study, which characterize long-term engraftment following cFMT, suggest that numerical donor similarity is not strictly related to clinical outcome and identify a persistent donor-specific effect on patient fecal microbial communities. Furthermore, results suggest that members of the  may be important targets to improve engraftment via cFMT. Recurrent  infection (rCDI) is the most common cause of hospital- and community-acquired diarrheal infection associated with antibiotic use. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a treatment that involves administration of fecal bacteria from a healthy donor to a recipient patient, is a highly effective rescue therapy for rCDI that is increasingly being incorporated into standard clinical practice. Encapsulated, freeze-dried preparations of fecal microbiota, administered orally, offer the simplest and most convenient route of FMT delivery for patients (cFMT). In this study, we evaluated the extent of bacterial engraftment following cFMT and the duration of donor bacterial persistence. All patients studied recovered clinically but showed differing patterns in long-term microbial community similarity to the donor that were associated with members of the bacterial group , previously shown to be prominent contributors to rCDI resistance. Results highlight long-lasting, donor-specific effects on recipient patient microbiota and reveal potential bacterial targets to improve cFMT engraftment."

            "#text": "The structure and function of microbial communities vary along environmental gradients; however, interlinking the two has been challenging. In this study, salinity was used as an environmental filter to study how it could shape trait distributions, community structures, and the resulting functions of soil microbes. The environmental filter was applied by salinizing nonsaline soil (0 to 22 mg NaCl g). Our targeted community trait distribution (salt tolerance) was determined with dose-response relationships between bacterial growth and salinity. The bacterial community structure responses were resolved with Illumina 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the microbial functions determined were respiration and bacterial and fungal growth. Salt exposure quickly resulted in filtered trait distributions, and stronger filters resulted in larger shifts. The filtered trait distributions correlated well with community composition differences, suggesting that trait distribution shifts were driven at least partly by species turnover. While salt exposure decreased respiration, microbial growth responses appeared to be characterized by competitive interactions. Fungal growth was highest when bacterial growth was inhibited by the highest salinity, and it was lowest when the bacterial growth rate peaked at intermediate salt levels. These findings corroborated a higher potential for fungal salt tolerance than bacterial salt tolerance for communities derived from a nonsaline soil. In conclusion, by using salt as an environmental filter, we could interlink the targeted trait distribution with both the community structure and resulting functions of soil microbes. Understanding the role of ecological communities in maintaining multiple ecosystem processes is a central challenge in ecology. Soil microbial communities perform vital ecosystem functions, such as the decomposition of organic matter to provide plant nutrition. However, despite the functional importance of soil microorganisms, attribution of ecosystem function to particular constituents of the microbial community has been impeded by a lack of information linking microbial processes to community composition and structure. Here, we apply a conceptual framework to determine how microbial communities influence ecosystem processes, by applying a \"top-down\" trait-based approach. By determining the dependence of microbial processes on environmental factors (e.g., the tolerance to salinity), we can define the aggregate response trait distribution of the community, which then can be linked to the community structure and the resulting function performed by the microbial community."

            "#text": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), also known as A20, is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme capable of ubiquitination or deubiquitination of its target proteins. In this study, we show that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection could induce the expression of A20 via the activation of the A20 promoter. The induction of A20 by HCV coincided with the loss of upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF-1), a transcription factor known to suppress the A20 promoter. The role of USF-1 in the regulation of the A20 promoter in HCV-infected cells was confirmed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, and its depletion was apparently mediated by proteasomes, as USF-1 could be stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to suppress the A20 expression. As the overexpression of A20 enhanced the replication of HCV and the silencing of A20 had the opposite effect, A20 is a positive regulator of HCV replication. Our further studies indicated that A20 enhanced the activity of the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In conclusion, our results demonstrated that HCV could induce the expression of A20 via the depletion of USF-1 to enhance its replication. Our study provided important information for further understanding the interaction between HCV and its host cells. Hepatitis C virus establishes chronic infection in approximately 85% of the patients whom it infects. However, the mechanism of how HCV evades host immunity to establish persistence is unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that HCV could induce the expression of the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, an important negative regulator of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and NF-κB signaling pathways. This induction of A20 enhanced HCV replication as it could stimulate the HCV IRES activity to enhance the translation of HCV proteins. The induction of A20 was mediated by the depletion of USF-1, a suppressor of the A20 promoter. Our study thus provides important information for further understanding the interaction between HCV and its host cells."

            "#text": "Global atmospheric loading of the climate-active gas nitrous oxide (NO) continues to increase. A significant proportion of anthropogenic NO emissions arises from microbial transformation of nitrogen-based fertilizers during denitrification, making microbial NO emissions a key target for greenhouse gas reduction strategies. The genetic, physiological, and environmental regulation of microbially mediated NO flux is poorly understood and therefore represents a critical knowledge gap in the development of successful mitigation approaches. We have previously mapped the transcriptional landscape of the model soil-denitrifying bacterium  Here, we show that a single bacterial small RNA (sRNA) can control the denitrification rate of  by stalling denitrification at nitrite reduction to limit production of downstream pathway intermediates and NO emissions. Overexpression of sRNA-29 downregulates nitrite reductase and limits NO and NO production by cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed 53 genes that are controlled by sRNA-29, one of which is a previously uncharacterized GntR-type transcriptional regulator. Overexpression of this regulator phenocopies sRNA-29 overexpression and allows us to propose a model whereby sRNA-29 enhances levels of the regulator to repress denitrification under appropriate conditions. Our identification of a new regulatory pathway controlling the core denitrification pathway in bacteria highlights the current chasm in knowledge regarding genetic regulation of this pivotal biogeochemical process, which needs to be closed to support future biological and chemical NO mitigation strategies. NO is an important greenhouse gas and a major cause of ozone depletion. Denitrifying bacteria play vital roles in the production and consumption of NO in many environments. Complete denitrification consists of the conversion of a soluble N-oxyanion, nitrate (NO), to an inert gaseous N-oxide, dinitrogen (N). Incomplete denitrification can occur if conditions are prohibitive, for example, under conditions of low soil copper concentrations, leading to emission of NO rather than N Although enzymatically well characterized, the genetic drivers that regulate denitrification in response to environmental and physiological cues are not fully understood. This study identified a new regulatory sRNA-based control mechanism for denitrification in the model denitrifying bacterium  Overexpression of this sRNA slows the rate of denitrification. This report highlights that there are gaps in understanding the regulation of this important pathway which need to be filled if strategies for NO mitigation can be rationally and carefully developed."

Our recent preliminary study showed that the ADAM10 genetic polymorphism was clinically associated with the development of sepsis, and little is known about the underlying mechanism. The aim of this study was to confirm the association between the ADAM10 promoter rs653765 G→A polymorphism and the progression of sepsis and to discover the underlying mechanism. Clinical data showed that the rs653765 G→A polymorphism was positively correlated with the development of sepsis, as evidenced by a multiple-center case-control association study with a large sample size, and showed that EGR1 and ADAM10 levels were associated well with the different subtypes of sepsis patients.  results demonstrated that the rs653765 G→A variants could functionally modulate ADAM10 promoter activity by altering the binding of the EGR1 transcription factor (TF) to the ADAM10 promoter, affecting the transcription and translation of the  gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay indicated the direct interaction. Functional studies further identified that the EGR1/ADAM10 pathway is important for the inflammatory response. EGR1 intervention  decreased host proinflammatory cytokine secretion and rescued the survival and tissue injury of the mouse endotoxemia model. Sepsis is characterized as life-threatening organ dysfunction, with unacceptably high mortality. Evidence has indicated that functional SNPs within inflammatory genes are associated with susceptibility, progression, and prognosis of sepsis. These mechanisms on which these susceptible sites depended often suggest the key pathogenesis and potential targets in sepsis. In the present study, we confirmed that a functional variant acts as an important genetic factor that confers the progression of sepsis in a large sample size and in multiple centers and revealed that the variants modulate the EGR1/ADAM10 pathway and influence the severity of sepsis. We believe that we provide an important insight into this new pathway involving the regulation of inflammatory process of sepsis based on the clinical genetic evidence, which will enhance the understanding of nosogenesis of sepsis and provide the potential target for inflammation-related diseases."

Typically, one BGC is responsible for the production of one or several similar compounds with bioactivities that usually only vary in terms of strength and/or specificity. Here we show that the previously described ferroverdins and bagremycins, which are families of metabolites with different bioactivities, are produced from the same BGC, whereby the fate of the biosynthetic pathway depends on iron availability. Under conditions of iron depletion, the monomeric bagremycins are formed, representing amino-aromatic antibiotics resulting from the condensation of 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid with -vinylphenol. Conversely, when iron is abundantly available, the biosynthetic pathway additionally produces a molecule based on -vinylphenyl-3-nitroso-4-hydroxybenzoate, which complexes iron to form the trimeric ferroverdins that have anticholesterol activity. Thus, our work shows a unique exception to the concept that BGCs should only produce a single family of molecules with one type of bioactivity and that in fact different bioactive molecules may be produced depending on the environmental conditions. Access to whole-genome sequences has exposed the general incidence of the so-called cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), thereby renewing their interest for natural product discovery. As a consequence, genome mining is the often first approach implemented to assess the potential of a microorganism for producing novel bioactive metabolites. By revealing a new level of complexity of natural product biosynthesis, we further illustrate the difficulty of estimation of the panel of molecules associated with a BGC based on genomic information alone. Indeed, we found that the same gene cluster is responsible for the production of compounds which differ in terms of structure and bioactivity. The production of these different compounds responds to different environmental triggers, which suggests that multiplication of culture conditions is essential for revealing the entire panel of molecules made by a single BGC."

            "#text": "Life in water-filled bedrock fissures in the continental deep biosphere is broadly constrained by energy and nutrient availability. Although these communities are alive, robust studies comparing active populations and metabolic processes across deep aquifers are lacking. This study analyzed three oligotrophic Fennoscandian Shield groundwaters, two \"modern marine\" waters that are replenished with organic carbon from the Baltic Sea and are likely less than 20 years old (171.3 and 415.4 m below sea level) and an extremely oligotrophic \"thoroughly mixed\" water (448.8 m below sea level) of unknown age that is composed of very old saline and marine waters. Cells were captured either using a sampling device that rapidly fixed RNA under  conditions or by filtering flowing groundwater over an extended period before fixation. Comparison of metatranscriptomes between the methods showed statistically similar transcript profiles for the respective water types, and they were analyzed as biological replicates. Study of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA confirmed active populations from all three domains of life, with many potentially novel unclassified populations present. Statistically supported differences between communities included heterotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria in the modern marine water at 171.3 m below sea level that has a higher organic carbon content than do largely autotrophic populations in the H- and CO-fed thoroughly mixed water. While this modern marine water had signatures of methanogenesis, syntrophic populations were predominantly in the thoroughly mixed water. The study provides a first statistical evaluation of differences in the active microbial communities in groundwaters differentially fed by organic carbon or \"geogases.\" Despite being separated from the photosynthesis-driven surface by both distance and time, the deep biosphere is an important driver for the earth's carbon and energy cycles. However, due to the difficulties in gaining access and low cell numbers, robust statistical omics studies have not been carried out, and this limits the conclusions that can be drawn. This study benchmarks the use of two separate sampling systems and demonstrates that they provide statistically similar RNA transcript profiles, importantly validating several previously published studies. The generated data are analyzed to identify statistically valid differences in active microbial community members and metabolic processes. The results highlight contrasting taxa and growth strategies in the modern marine waters that are influenced by recent infiltration of Baltic Sea water versus the hydrogen- and carbon dioxide-fed, extremely oligotrophic, thoroughly mixed water."

The ability of NTM to form surface-attached biofilms in the nonhost environment and corded aggregates  is important to their ability to persist in both contexts. Underlying the development of these multicellular structures is the capacity of mycobacterial cells to adhere to one another. Unlike most other bacteria, NTM spontaneously and constitutively aggregate , hindering our ability to understand the transition between planktonic and aggregated cells. While culturing a model NTM, , in rich medium, we fortuitously discovered that planktonic cells accumulate after ∼3 days of growth. By providing selective pressure for bacteria that disperse earlier, we isolated a strain with two mutations in the oligopeptide permease operon (). A mutant lacking the  operon (Δ) disperses earlier than wild type (WT) due to a defect in nutrient uptake. Experiments with WT  revealed that growth as aggregates is favored when carbon is replete, but under conditions of low available carbon relative to available nitrogen,  grows as planktonic cells. By adjusting carbon and nitrogen sources in defined medium, we tuned the cellular C/N ratio such that  grows either as aggregates or as planktonic cells. C/N-mediated aggregation regulation is widespread among NTM with the possible exception of rough-colony  isolates. Altogether, we show that NTM aggregation is a controlled process that is governed by the relative availability of carbon and nitrogen for metabolism. Free-living bacteria can assemble into multicellular structures called biofilms. Biofilms help bacteria tolerate multiple stresses, including antibiotics and the host immune system. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are a group of emerging opportunistic pathogens that utilize biofilms to adhere to household plumbing and showerheads and to avoid phagocytosis by host immune cells. Typically, bacteria regulate biofilm formation by controlling expression of adhesive structures to attach to surfaces and other bacterial cells. Mycobacteria harbor a unique cell wall built chiefly of long-chain mycolic acids that confers hydrophobicity and has been thought to cause constitutive aggregation in liquid media. Here we show that aggregation is instead a regulated process dictated by the balance of available carbon and nitrogen. Understanding that mycobacteria utilize metabolic cues to regulate the transition between planktonic and aggregated cells reveals an inroad to controlling biofilm formation through targeted therapeutics."

            "#text": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that is associated with lymphomas as well as nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinomas. Although carcinomas account for almost 90% of EBV-associated cancers, progress in examining EBV's role in their pathogenesis has been limited by difficulty in establishing latent infection in nontransformed epithelial cells. Recently, EBV infection of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-immortalized normal oral keratinocytes (NOKs) has emerged as a model that recapitulates aspects of EBV infection , such as differentiation-associated viral replication. Using uninfected NOKs and NOKs infected with the Akata strain of EBV (NOKs-Akata), we examined changes in gene expression due to EBV infection and differentiation. Latent EBV infection produced very few significant gene expression changes in undifferentiated NOKs but significantly reduced the extent of differentiation-induced gene expression changes. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that differentiation-induced downregulation of the cell cycle and metabolism pathways was markedly attenuated in NOKs-Akata relative to that in uninfected NOKs. We also observed that pathways induced by differentiation were less upregulated in NOKs-Akata. We observed decreased differentiation markers and increased suprabasal MCM7 expression in NOKs-Akata versus NOKs when both were grown in raft cultures, consistent with our transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) results. These effects were also observed in NOKs infected with a replication-defective EBV mutant (AkataΔRZ), implicating mechanisms other than lytic-gene-induced host shutoff. Our results help to define the mechanisms by which EBV infection alters keratinocyte differentiation and provide a basis for understanding the role of EBV in epithelial cancers. Latent infection by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an early event in the development of EBV-associated carcinomas. In oral epithelial tissues, EBV establishes a lytic infection of differentiated epithelial cells to facilitate the spread of the virus to new hosts. Because of limitations in existing model systems, the effects of latent EBV infection on undifferentiated and differentiating epithelial cells are poorly understood. Here, we characterize latent infection of an hTERT-immortalized oral epithelial cell line (NOKs). We find that although EBV expresses a latency pattern similar to that seen in EBV-associated carcinomas, infection of undifferentiated NOKs results in differential expression of a small number of host genes. In differentiating NOKs, however, EBV has a more substantial effect, reducing the extent of differentiation and delaying the exit from the cell cycle. This effect may synergize with preexisting cellular abnormalities to prevent exit from the cell cycle, representing a critical step in the development of cancer."

The underlying mechanisms and the ecological relevance of changing cell shape and size remain unclear in most cases. One bacterium that undergoes extensive shape-shifting in response to changing growth conditions is the freshwater bacterium  When incubated for an extended time in stationary phase, a subpopulation of  forms viable filamentous cells with a helical shape. Here, we demonstrated that this stationary-phase-induced filamentation results from downregulation of most critical cell cycle regulators and a consequent block of DNA replication and cell division while cell growth and metabolism continue. Our data indicate that this response is triggered by a combination of three stresses caused by prolonged growth in complex medium, namely, the depletion of phosphate, alkaline pH, and an excess of ammonium. We found that these conditions are experienced in the summer months during algal blooms near the surface in freshwater lakes, a natural habitat of , suggesting that filamentous growth is a common response of  to its environment. Finally, we demonstrate that when grown in a biofilm, the filamentous cells can reach beyond the surface of the biofilm and potentially access nutrients or release progeny. Altogether, our work highlights the ability of bacteria to alter their morphology and suggests how this behavior might enable adaptation to changing environments. Many bacteria drastically change their cell size and morphology in response to changing environmental conditions. Here, we demonstrate that the freshwater bacterium  and related species transform into filamentous cells in response to conditions that commonly occur in their natural habitat as a result of algal blooms during the warm summer months. These filamentous cells may be better able to scavenge nutrients when they grow in biofilms and to escape from protist predation during planktonic growth. Our findings suggest that seasonal changes and variations in the microbial composition of the natural habitat can have profound impact on the cell biology of individual organisms. Furthermore, our work highlights that bacteria exist in morphological and physiological states in nature that can strongly differ from those commonly studied in the laboratory."

            "#text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) eradication or long-term suppression in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires an understanding of all viral reservoirs that could contribute to viral rebound after ART interruption. CD4 T cells (CD4s) are recognized as the predominant reservoir in HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals. However, macrophages are also infected by HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) during acute infection and may persist throughout ART, contributing to the size of the latent reservoir. We sought to determine whether tissue macrophages contribute to the SIVmac251 reservoir in suppressed macaques. Using cell-specific quantitative viral outgrowth assays (CD4-QVOA and MΦ-QVOA), we measured functional latent reservoirs in CD4s and macrophages in ART-suppressed SIVmac251-infected macaques. Spleen, lung, and brain in all suppressed animals contained latently infected macrophages, undetectable or low-level SIV RNA, and detectable SIV DNA. Silent viral genomes with potential for reactivation and viral spread were also identified in blood monocytes, although these cells might not be considered reservoirs due to their short life span. Additionally, virus produced in the MΦ-QVOA was capable of infecting healthy activated CD4s. Our results strongly suggest that functional latent reservoirs in CD4s and macrophages can contribute to viral rebound and reestablishment of productive infection after ART interruption. These findings should be considered in the design and implementation of future HIV cure strategies. This study provides further evidence that the latent reservoir is comprised of both CD4 T cells and myeloid cells. The data presented here suggest that CD4 T cells and macrophages found throughout tissues in the body can contain replication-competent SIV and contribute to rebound of the virus after treatment interruption. Additionally, we have shown that monocytes in blood contain latent virus and, though not considered a reservoir themselves due to their short life span, could contribute to the size of the latent reservoir upon entering the tissue and differentiating into long-lived macrophages. These new insights into the size and location of the SIV reservoir using a model that is heavily studied in the HIV field could have great implications for HIV-infected individuals and should be taken into consideration with the development of future HIV cure strategies."

They are powered by dynamic ATPases that harness energy from binding and hydrolyzing ATP through a cycle that involves the closing and reopening of their two ATP-binding domains. The LptBFGC exporter is an essential ABC transporter that assembles lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria to form a permeability barrier against many antibiotics. LptBFGC extracts newly synthesized LPS molecules from the inner membrane and powers their transport across the periplasm and through the outer membrane. How LptBFGC functions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the C-terminal domain of the dimeric LptB ATPase is essential for LPS transport in  Specific changes in the C-terminal domain of LptB cause LPS transport defects that can be repaired by intragenic suppressors altering the ATP-binding domains. Surprisingly, we found that each of two lethal changes in the ATP-binding and C-terminal domains of LptB, when present in combined form, suppressed the defects associated with the other to restore LPS transport to wild-type levels both  and  We present biochemical evidence explaining the effect that each of these mutations has on LptB function and how the observed cosuppression results from the opposing lethal effects these changes have on the dimerization state of the LptB ATPase. We therefore propose that these sites modulate the closing and reopening of the LptB dimer, providing insight into how the LptBFGC transporter cycles to export LPS to the cell surface and how to inhibit this essential envelope biogenesis process. Gram-negative bacteria are naturally resistant to many antibiotics because their surface is covered by the glycolipid LPS. Newly synthesized LPS is transported across the cell envelope by the multiprotein Lpt machinery, which includes LptBFGC, an unusual ABC transporter that extracts LPS from the inner membrane. Like in other ABC transporters, the LptBFGC transport cycle is driven by the cyclical conformational changes that a cytoplasmic, dimeric ATPase, LptB, undergoes when binding and hydrolyzing ATP. How these conformational changes are controlled in ABC transporters is poorly understood. Here, we identified two lethal changes in LptB that, when combined, remarkably restore wild-type transport function. Biochemical studies revealed that the two changes affect different steps in the transport cycle, having opposing, lethal effects on LptB's dimerization cycle. Our work provides mechanistic details about the LptBFGC extractor that could be used to develop Lpt inhibitors that would overcome the innate antibiotic resistance of Gram-negative bacteria."

Variability in the O-antigen structure constitutes the basis for the establishment of the serotyping schema. We pursued a two-pronged approach to define the basis for O-antigen structural diversity. First, we developed a bottom-up systems biology approach to O-antigen metabolism by building a reconstruction of  O-antigen biosynthesis and used it to (i) update 410 existing  strain-specific metabolic models, (ii) predict a strain's serogroup and its O-antigen glycan synthesis capability (yielding 98% agreement with experimental data), and (iii) extend our workflow to more than 1,400 Gram-negative strains. Second, we used a top-down pangenome analysis to elucidate the genetic basis for intraserogroup O-antigen structural variations. We assembled a database of O-antigen gene islands from over 11,000 sequenced  strains, revealing (i) that gene duplication, pseudogene formation, gene deletion, and bacteriophage insertion elements occur ubiquitously across serogroups; (ii) novel serotypes in the group O:4 B2 variant, as well as an additional genotype variant for group O:4, and (iii) two novel O-antigen gene islands in understudied subspecies. We thus comprehensively defined the genetic basis for O-antigen diversity. Lipopolysaccharides are a major component of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. They are composed of a conserved lipid structure that is embedded in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and a polysaccharide known as the O-antigen. O-antigens are highly variable in structure across strains of a species and are crucial to a bacterium's interactions with its environment. They constitute the first line of defense against both the immune system and bacteriophage infections and have been shown to mediate antimicrobial resistance. The significance of our research is in identifying the metabolic and genetic differences within and across O-antigen groups in  strains. Our effort constitutes a first step toward characterizing the O-antigen metabolic network across Gram-negative organisms and a comprehensive overview of genetic variations in ."

            "#text": "Using multiple viral systems, and performing silencing approaches, overexpression approaches, and experiments in knockout cells, we report, for the first time, that interferon (IFN)-induced protein 44 (IFI44) positively affects virus production and negatively modulates innate immune responses induced after viral infections. Moreover, IFI44 is able to rescue poly(I·C)- and IFN-mediated inhibition of virus growth. Furthermore, we report a novel interaction of IFI44 with the cellular factor FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5), which binds to cellular kinases such as the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (IκB) kinases (IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKε). Importantly, in the presence of FKBP5, IFI44 decreases the ability of IKKβ to phosphorylate IκBα and the ability of IKKε to phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), providing a novel mechanism for the function of IFI44 in negatively modulating IFN responses. Remarkably, these new IFI44 functions may have implications for diseases associated with excessive immune signaling and for controlling virus infections mediated by IFN responses. Innate immune responses mediated by IFN and inflammatory cytokines are critical for controlling virus replication. Nevertheless, exacerbated innate immune responses could be detrimental for the host and feedback mechanisms are needed to maintain the cellular homeostasis. In this work, we describe a completely novel function for IFI44 in negatively modulating the innate immune responses induced after viral infections. We show that decreasing IFI44 expression by using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or by generating knockout (KO) cells impairs virus production and increases the levels of IFN responses. Moreover, we report a novel interaction of IFI44 with the cellular protein FKBP5, which in turn interacts with kinases essential for type I and III IFN induction and signaling, such as the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (IκB) kinases IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKε. Our data indicate that binding of IFI44 to FKBP5 decreased the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IκBα mediated by IKKε and IKKβ, respectively, providing a likely explanation for the function of IFI44 in negatively modulating IFN responses. These results provide new insights into the induction of innate immune responses and suggest that IFI44 is a new potential antiviral target for reducing virus replication."

Eight effectors, including ankyrin H (AnkH), are common to all  species. The AnkH effector is also present in  and  To date, no pathogenic effectors have ever been described that directly interfere with host cell transcription. We determined that the host nuclear protein La-related protein 7 (LARP7), which is a component of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, interacts with AnkH in the host cell nucleus. The AnkH-LARP7 interaction partially impedes interactions of the 7SK snRNP components with LARP7, interfering with transcriptional elongation by polymerase (Pol) II. Consistent with that, our data show AnkH-dependent global reprogramming of transcription of macrophages infected by  The crystal structure of AnkH shows that it contains four N-terminal ankyrin repeats, followed by a cysteine protease-like domain and an α-helical C-terminal domain. A substitution within the β-hairpin loop of the third ankyrin repeat results in diminishment of LARP7-AnkH interactions and phenocopies the  null mutant defect in intracellular growth. LARP7 knockdown partially suppresses intracellular proliferation of wild-type (WT) bacteria and increases the severity of the defect of the Δ mutant, indicating a role for LARP7 in permissiveness of host cells to intracellular bacterial infection. We conclude that the AnkH-LARP7 interaction impedes interaction of LARP7 with 7SK snRNP, which would block transcriptional elongation by Pol II, leading to host global transcriptional reprogramming and permissiveness to  For intracellular pathogens to thrive in host cells, an environment that supports survival and replication needs to be established.  accomplishes this through the activity of the ∼330 effector proteins that are injected into host cells during infection. Effector functions range from hijacking host trafficking pathways to altering host cell machinery, resulting in altered cell biology and innate immunity. One such pathway is the host protein synthesis pathway. Five  effectors have been identified that alter host cell translation, and 2 effectors have been identified that indirectly affect host cell transcription. No pathogenic effectors have been described that directly interfere with host cell transcription. Here we show a direct interaction of the AnkH effector with a host cell transcription complex involved in transcriptional elongation. We identify a novel process by which AnkH interferes with host transcriptional elongation through interference with formation of a functional complex and show that this interference is required for pathogen proliferation."

            "#text": "Bacteria in nature are known to survive for long periods under restricting conditions, mainly by reducing their growth rate and metabolic activity. Here, we uncover a novel strategy utilized by bacterial cells to resist aging by propagating rather than halting division. Bacterial aging was monitored by inspecting colonies of the Gram-positive soil bacterium , which is capable of differentiating into various cell types under nutrient exhaustion. We revealed that after days of incubation, rejuvenating subpopulations, arrayed over the mother colony, emerged. These subpopulations were found to harbor mutations in a variety of genes, restricting the ability of the cells to differentiate. Surprisingly, even mutations that are not classically designated to developmental pathways, concluded in differentiation deficiency, indicating that multiple paths can reach this same outcome. We provide evidence that the evolved mutants continue to divide under conditions that favor entry into quiescence, hence becoming abundant within the aging population. The occurrence of such nondifferentiating mutants could impact bacterial population dynamics in natural niches. Until now, bacterial cells facing nutrient deprivation were shown to enter dormancy as a strategy to survive prolonged stress, with the most established examples being sporulation, stationary phase, and persistence. Here, we uncovered an opposing strategy for long-term bacterial survival, in which mutant subpopulations cope with a challenging niche by proliferating rather than by stalling division. We show that this feature stems from mutations in genes disturbing the capability of the cells to differentiate into a quiescent state, enabling them to divide under restrictive conditions. Our study challenges the dogma of bacterial aging by highlighting an additional survival strategy resembling that of cancerous cells in animal organs."

            "#text": "In this work, by comparing genomes of closely related individuals of  isolated at a spatial microscale (millimeters or centimeters), we investigated the extent and impact of horizontal gene transfer in the diversification of a natural  population. We show that despite these conspecific strains sharing a recent common ancestor, all harbored significantly different gene contents, implying massive and rapid gene flux. The accessory genome of the strains was distributed across insertion/deletion events (indels) ranging from one to several hundreds of genes. Indels were preferentially located in the arms of the linear chromosomes (ca. 12 Mb) and appeared to form recombination hot spots. Some of them harbored biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) whose products confer an inhibitory capacity and may constitute public goods that can favor the cohesiveness of the bacterial population. Moreover, a significant proportion of these variable genes were either plasmid borne or harbored signatures of actinomycete integrative and conjugative elements (AICEs). We propose that conjugation is the main driver for the indel flux and diversity in  populations. Horizontal gene transfer is a rapid and efficient way to diversify bacterial gene pools. Currently, little is known about this gene flux within natural soil populations. Using comparative genomics of  strains belonging to the same species and isolated at microscale, we reveal frequent transfer of a significant fraction of the pangenome. We show that it occurs at a time scale enabling the population to diversify and to cope with its changing environment, notably, through the production of public goods."

            "#text": "Eukaryotic cells share a basic scheme of internal organization featuring membrane-based organelles. The use of fluorescent proteins (FPs) greatly facilitated live-cell imaging of organelle dynamics and protein trafficking. One major limitation of this approach is that the fusion of an FP to a target protein can and often does compromise the function of the target protein and alter its subcellular localization. The optimization process to obtain a desirable fusion construct can be time-consuming or even unsuccessful. In this work, we set out to provide a validated set of FP-based markers for major organelles in the budding yeast (). Out of over 160 plasmids constructed, we present a final set of 42 plasmids, the recommendations for which are backed up by meticulous evaluations. The tool set includes three colors (green, red, and blue) and covers the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nucleus, Golgi apparatus, endosomes, vacuoles, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets. The fidelity of the markers was established by systematic cross-comparison and quantification. Functional assays were performed to examine the impact of marker expression on the secretory pathway, endocytic pathway, and metabolic activities of mitochondria and peroxisomes. Concomitantly, our work constitutes a reassessment of organelle identities in this model organism. Our data support the recognition that \"late Golgi\" and \"early endosomes,\" two seemingly distinct terms, denote the same compartment in yeast. Conversely, all other organelles can be visually separated from each other at the resolution of conventional light microscopy, and quantification results justify their classification as distinct entities. Cells contain elaborate internal structures. For eukaryotic cells, like those in our bodies, the internal space is compartmentalized into membrane-bound organelles, each tasked with specialized functions. Oftentimes, one needs to visualize organelles to understand a complex cellular process. Here, we provide a validated set of fluorescent protein-based markers for major organelles in budding yeast. Yeast is a commonly used model when investigating basic mechanisms shared among eukaryotes. Fluorescent proteins are produced by cells themselves, avoiding the need for expensive chemical dyes. Through extensive cross-comparison, we make sure that each of our markers labels and only labels the intended organelle. We also carefully examined if the presence of our markers has any negative impact on the functionality of the cells and found none. Our work also helps answer a related question: are the structures we see really what we think they are?"

            "#text": "Intraspecific variation in plant nutrient and defensive traits can regulate ecosystem-level processes, such as decomposition and transformation of plant carbon and nutrients. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of ecosystem functions at local scales may facilitate predictions of the resistance and resilience of these functions to change. We evaluated how riverine bacterial community assembly and predicted gene content corresponded to decomposition rates of green leaf inputs from red alder trees into rivers of Washington State, USA. Previously, we documented accelerated decomposition rates for leaves originating from trees growing adjacent to the site of decomposition versus more distant locales, suggesting that microbes have a \"home-field advantage\" in decomposing local leaves. Here, we identified repeatable stages of bacterial succession, each defined by dominant taxa with predicted gene content associated with metabolic pathways relevant to the leaf characteristics and course of decomposition. \"Home\" leaves contained bacterial communities with distinct functional capacities to degrade aromatic compounds. Given known spatial variation of alder aromatics, this finding helps explain locally accelerated decomposition. Bacterial decomposer communities adjust to intraspecific variation in leaves at spatial scales of less than a kilometer, providing a mechanism for rapid response to changes in resources such as range shifts among plant genotypes. Such rapid responses among bacterial communities in turn may maintain high rates of carbon and nutrient cycling through aquatic ecosystems. Community ecologists have traditionally treated individuals within a species as uniform, with individual-level biodiversity rarely considered as a regulator of community and ecosystem function. In our study system, we have documented clear evidence of within-species variation causing local ecosystem adaptation to fluxes across ecosystem boundaries. In this striking pattern of a \"home-field advantage,\" leaves from individual trees tend to decompose most rapidly when immediately adjacent to their parent tree. Here, we merge community ecology experiments with microbiome approaches to describe how bacterial communities adjust to within-species variation in leaves over spatial scales of less than a kilometer. The results show that bacterial community compositional changes facilitate rapid ecosystem responses to environmental change, effectively maintaining high rates of carbon and nutrient cycling through ecosystems."

This genetic lineage emerged several decades ago and remains a major global health care challenge. In this study, genomic epidemiology was used to investigate the emergence, evolution, and persistence of ST258 carbapenem-resistant  outbreak-causing lineages at a large tertiary care hospital over 8 years. A time-based phylogenetic analysis of 136 ST258 isolates demonstrated the succession of multiple genetically distinct ST258 sublineages over the 8-year period. Ongoing genomic surveillance identified the emergence and persistence of several distinct clonal ST258 populations. Patterns of multidrug resistance determinants and plasmid replicons were consistent with continued evolution and persistence of these populations. Five ST258 outbreaks were documented, including three that were caused by the same clonal lineage. Mutations in genes encoding effectors of biofilm production and iron acquisition were identified among persistent clones. Two emergent lineages bearing  integrative conjugative element 10 (ICE) and harboring yersiniabactin and colibactin virulence factors were identified. The results show how distinct ST258 subpopulations have evolved and persisted within the same hospital over nearly a decade. The carbapenem class of antibiotics is invaluable for the treatment of selected multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The continued transmission of carbapenem-resistant bacteria such as ST258  is of serious global public health concern, as treatment options for these infections are limited. This genomic epidemiologic investigation traced the natural history of ST258  in a single health care setting over nearly a decade. We found that distinct ST258 subpopulations have caused both device-associated and ward-associated outbreaks, and some of these populations remain endemic within our hospital to the present day. The finding of virulence determinants among emergent ST258 clones supports the idea of convergent evolution of drug-resistant and virulent CRKP strains and highlights the need for continued surveillance, prevention, and control efforts to address emergent and evolving ST258 populations in the health care setting."

Only rarely are there examples of HGT where noncoding DNA is also reported. The gene encoding the wheat virulence protein ToxA and the surrounding 14 kb is one of these rare examples.  has been horizontally transferred between three fungal wheat pathogens (, , and ) as part of a conserved ∼14 kb element which contains coding and noncoding regions. Here we used long-read sequencing to define the extent of HGT between these three fungal species. Construction of near-chromosomal-level assemblies enabled identification of terminal inverted repeats on either end of the 14 kb region, typical of a type II DNA transposon. This is the first description of  with complete transposon features, which we call ToxhAT. In all three species, ToxhAT resides in a large (140-to-250 kb) transposon-rich genomic island which is absent in isolates that do not carry the gene (annotated here as  ). We demonstrate that the horizontal transfer of ToxhAT between  and  occurred as part of a large (∼80 kb) HGT which is now undergoing extensive decay. In , in contrast, ToxhAT and its resident genomic island are mobile within the genome. Together, these data provide insight into the noncoding regions that facilitate HGT between eukaryotes and into the genomic processes which mask the extent of HGT between these species. This work dissects the tripartite horizontal transfer , a gene that has a direct negative impact on global wheat yields. Defining the extent of horizontally transferred DNA is important because it can provide clues to the mechanisms that facilitate HGT. Our analysis of  and its surrounding 14 kb suggests that this gene was horizontally transferred in two independent events, with one event likely facilitated by a type II DNA transposon. These horizontal transfer events are now in various processes of decay in each species due to the repeated insertion of new transposons and subsequent rounds of targeted mutation by a fungal genome defense mechanism known as repeat induced point mutation. This work highlights the role that HGT plays in the evolution of host adaptation in eukaryotic pathogens. It also increases the growing body of evidence indicating that transposons facilitate adaptive HGT events between fungi present in similar environments and hosts."

            "#text": "Bacterial adhesion is accompanied by altered gene expression, leading to \"emergent\" properties of biofilm bacteria that are alien to planktonic ones. With the aim of revealing the role of environmental adhesion forces in emergent biofilm properties, genes in  UA159 and a quorum-sensing-deficient mutant were identified that become expressed after adhesion to substratum surfaces. Using atomic force microscopy, adhesion forces of initial  colonizers on four different substrata were determined and related to gene expression. Adhesion forces upon initial contact were similarly low across different substrata, ranging between 0.2 and 1.2 nN regardless of the strain considered. Bond maturation required up to 21 s, depending on the strain and substratum surface involved, but stationary adhesion forces also were similar in the parent and in the mutant strain. However, stationary adhesion forces were largest on hydrophobic silicone rubber (19 to 20 nN), while being smallest on hydrophilic glass (3 to 4 nN).  gene expression in thin (34 to 48 μm) 5-h  UA159 biofilms was most sensitive to adhesion forces, while expression of  and  expressions was weakly sensitive. , , , and  expression was insensitive to adhesion forces. In thicker (98 to 151 μm) 24-h biofilms, adhesion-force-induced gene expression and emergent extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production were limited to the first 20 to 30 μm above a substratum surface. In the quorum-sensing-deficient , adhesion-force-controlled gene expression was absent in both 5- and 24-h biofilms. Thus, initial colonizers of substratum surfaces sense adhesion forces that externally trigger emergent biofilm properties over a limited distance above a substratum surface through quorum sensing. A new concept in biofilm science is introduced: \"adhesion force sensitivity of genes,\" defining the degree up to which expression of different genes in adhering bacteria is controlled by the environmental adhesion forces they experience. Analysis of gene expression as a function of height in a biofilm showed that the information about the substratum surface to which initially adhering bacteria adhere is passed up to a biofilm height of 20 to 30 μm above a substratum surface, highlighting the importance and limitations of cell-to-cell communication in a biofilm. Bacteria in a biofilm mode of growth, as opposed to planktonic growth, are responsible for the great majority of human infections, predicted to become the number one cause of death in 2050. The concept of adhesion force sensitivity of genes provides better understanding of bacterial adaptation in biofilms, direly needed for the design of improved therapeutic measures that evade the recalcitrance of biofilm bacteria to antimicrobials."

However, the distribution, metabolisms, cellular structures, and ecology of the members within this superphylum are not well understood. Here we provide a meta-analysis of the environmental distribution of the Asgard archaea, based on available 16S rRNA gene sequences. Metagenome sequencing of samples from a salt-crusted lagoon on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico allowed the assembly of a new  and three  genomes. Comparative analyses of all known  and  genomes revealed overlapping genome content, including central carbon metabolism. Members of both groups contained putative reductive dehalogenase genes, suggesting that these organisms might be able to metabolize halogenated organic compounds. Unlike the first report on , we identified genes encoding glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase in all - and  genomes, suggesting that these organisms are able to synthesize bona fide archaeal lipids with their characteristic glycerol stereochemistry. Microorganisms of the superphylum Asgard  are considered to be the closest living prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes (including plants and animals) and thus promise to give insights into the early evolution of more complex life forms. However, very little is known about their biology as none of the organisms has yet been cultivated in the laboratory.

Identification of essential genes at all different stages of the  life cycle is urgently required for clinical development of tools for malaria control and eradication. However, the study of  is limited by the inability to genetically modify the parasite throughout its life cycle with the currently available genetic tools. Here, we describe the detailed characterization of a new marker-free  parasite line that expresses rapamycin-inducible Cre recombinase across the full life cycle. Using this parasite line, we were able to conditionally delete the essential invasion ligand AMA1 in three different developmental stages for the first time. We further confirm efficient gene deletion by targeting the nonessential kinase FIKK7.1. One of the major limitations in studying  is that so far only asexual stages are amenable to rapid conditional genetic modification. The most promising drug targets and vaccine candidates, however, have been refractory to genetic modification because they are essential during the blood stage or for transmission in the mosquito vector. This leaves a major gap in our understanding of parasite proteins in most life cycle stages and hinders genetic validation of drug and vaccine targets. Here, we describe a method that supports conditional gene deletion across the  life cycle for the first time. We demonstrate its potential by deleting essential and nonessential genes at different parasite stages, which opens up completely new avenues for the study of malaria and drug development. It may also allow the realization of novel vaccination strategies using attenuated parasites."

            "#text": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects and activates resting human B lymphocytes, reprograms them, induces their proliferation, and establishes a latent infection in them. In established EBV-infected cell lines, many viral latent genes are expressed. Their roles in supporting the continuous proliferation of EBV-infected B cells  are known, but their functions in the early, prelatent phase of infection have not been investigated systematically. In studies during the first 8 days of infection using derivatives of EBV with mutations in single genes of EBVs, we found only Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) to be essential for activating naive human B lymphocytes, inducing their growth in cell volume, driving them into rapid cell divisions, and preventing cell death in a subset of infected cells. EBNA-LP, latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A), and the viral microRNAs have supportive, auxiliary functions, but mutants of LMP1, EBNA3A, EBNA3C, and the noncoding Epstein-Barr virus with small RNA (EBERs) had no discernible phenotype compared with wild-type EBV. B cells infected with a double mutant of EBNA3A and 3C had an unexpected proliferative advantage and did not regulate the DNA damage response (DDR) of the infected host cell in the prelatent phase. Even EBNA1, which has very critical long-term functions in maintaining and replicating the viral genomic DNA in established cell lines, was dispensable for the early activation of infected cells. Our findings document that the virus dose is a decisive parameter and indicate that EBNA2 governs the infected cells initially and implements a strictly controlled temporal program independent of other viral latent genes. It thus appears that EBNA2 is sufficient to control all requirements for clonal cellular expansion and to reprogram human B lymphocytes from energetically quiescent to activated cells. The preferred target of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is human resting B lymphocytes. We found that their infection induces a well-coordinated, time-driven program that starts with a substantial increase in cell volume, followed by cellular DNA synthesis after 3 days and subsequent rapid rounds of cell divisions on the next day accompanied by some DNA replication stress (DRS). Two to 3 days later, the cells decelerate and turn into stably proliferating lymphoblast cell lines. With the aid of 16 different recombinant EBV strains, we investigated the individual contributions of EBV's multiple latent genes during early B-cell infection and found that many do not exert a detectable phenotype or contribute little to EBV's prelatent phase. The exception is EBNA2 that is essential in governing all aspects of B-cell reprogramming. EBV relies on EBNA2 to turn the infected B lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts preparing the infected host cell for the ensuing stable, latent phase of viral infection. In the early steps of B-cell reprogramming, viral latent genes other than EBNA2 are dispensable, but some, EBNA-LP, for example, support the viral program and presumably stabilize the infected cells once viral latency is established."

The ancestral strain of  also encodes an additional sigma factor homolog, ZpdN, not found in lab strains due to being encoded on the large, low-copy-number plasmid pBS32, which was lost during domestication. DNA damage triggers pBS32 hyperreplication and cell death in a manner that depends on ZpdN, but how ZpdN mediates these effects is unknown. Here, we show that ZpdN is a bona fide sigma factor that can direct RNA polymerase to transcribe ZpdN-dependent genes, and we rename ZpdN SigN accordingly. Rend-seq (end-enriched transcriptome sequencing) analysis was used to determine the SigN regulon on pBS32, and the 5' ends of transcripts were used to predict the SigN consensus sequence. Finally, we characterize the regulation of SigN itself and show that it is transcribed by at least three promoters:  , a strong SigA-dependent LexA-repressed promoter;  , a weak SigA-dependent constitutive promoter; and  , a SigN-dependent promoter. Thus, in response to DNA damage SigN is derepressed and then experiences positive feedback. How cells die in a pBS32-dependent manner remains unknown, but we predict that death is the product of expressing one or more genes in the SigN regulon. Sigma factors are utilized by bacteria to control and regulate gene expression. Some sigma factors are activated during times of stress to ensure the survival of the bacterium. Here, we report the presence of a sigma factor that is encoded on a plasmid that leads to cellular death after DNA damage."

Antibiotic-tolerant persisters largely account for this paradox. In spite of their significance in the recalcitrance of chronic infections, the mechanism of persister formation is poorly understood. We previously reported that a decrease in ATP levels leads to drug tolerance in , , and  We reasoned that stochastic fluctuation in the expression of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes can produce cells with low energy levels.  knockouts in glutamate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase, and fumarase have low ATP levels and exhibit increased tolerance of fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, and β-lactam antibiotics. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of TCA genes shows a broad Gaussian distribution in a population, with differences of over 3 orders of magnitude in the levels of expression between individual cells. Sorted cells with low levels of TCA enzyme expression have an increased tolerance of antibiotic treatment. These findings suggest that fluctuations in the levels of expression of energy-generating components serve as a mechanism of persister formation. Persister cells are rare phenotypic variants that are able to survive antibiotic treatment. Unlike resistant bacteria, which have specific mechanisms to prevent antibiotics from binding to their targets, persisters evade antibiotic killing by entering a tolerant nongrowing state. Persisters have been implicated in chronic infections in multiple species, and growing evidence suggests that persister cells are responsible for many cases of antibiotic treatment failure. New antibiotic treatment strategies aim to kill tolerant persister cells more effectively, but the mechanism of tolerance has remained unclear until now."

            "#text": "The transition from a planktonic lifestyle to a host-attached state is often critical for bacterial virulence. Upon attachment to host cells, enteropathogenic  (EPEC) employs a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject into the host cells ∼20 effector proteins, including Tir. CesT, which is encoded from the same operon downstream of , is a Tir-bound chaperone that facilitates Tir translocation. Upon Tir translocation, the liberated CesT remains in the bacterial cytoplasm and antagonizes the posttranscriptional regulator CsrA, thus eliciting global regulation in the infecting pathogen. Importantly, tight control of the Tir/CesT ratio is vital, since an uncontrolled surge in free CesT levels may repress CsrA in an untimely manner, thus abrogating colonization. We investigated how fluctuations in Tir translation affect the regulation of this ratio. By creating mutations that cause the premature termination of Tir translation, we revealed that the untranslated  mRNA becomes highly unstable, resulting in a rapid drop in  mRNA levels and, thus, CesT levels. This mechanism couples Tir and CesT levels to ensure a stable Tir/CesT ratio. Our results expose an additional level of regulation that enhances the efficacy of the initial interaction of EPEC with the host cell, providing a better understanding of the bacterial switch from the planktonic to the cell-adherent lifestyle. Host colonization by extracellular pathogens often entails the transition from a planktonic lifestyle to a host-attached state. Enteropathogenic  (EPEC), a Gram-negative pathogen, attaches to the intestinal epithelium of the host and employs a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the cytoplasm of infected cells. The most abundant effector protein injected is Tir, whose translocation is dependent on the Tir-bound chaperon CesT. Upon Tir injection, the liberated CesT binds to and inhibits the posttranscriptional regulator CsrA, resulting in reprogramming of gene expression in the host-attached bacteria. Thus, adaptation to the host-attached state involves dynamic remodeling of EPEC gene expression, which is mediated by the relative levels of Tir and CesT. Fluctuating from the optimal Tir/CesT ratio results in a decrease in EPEC virulence. Here we elucidate a posttranscriptional circuit that prevents sharp variations from this ratio, thus improving host colonization."

Deletion of NS1 (DelNS1) would create a safer and more extensively immunogenic live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccine. However, DelNS1 viruses are very difficult to grow in regular vaccine-producing systems, which has hampered the application of DelNS1 LAIV vaccines in humans. We have developed two master backbones of deleted-NS1 (DelNS1) viral genomes from influenza A or B viruses which contain novel adaptive mutations to support DelNS1-LAIV replication. These DelNS1-LAIVs are highly attenuated in human cells  and nonpathogenic in mice but replicate well in vaccine-producing cells. Both influenza A and influenza B DelNS1 LAIVs grow better at 33°C than at 37 to 39°C. Vaccination with DelNS1 LAIV performed once is enough to provide potent protection against lethal challenge with homologous virus and strong long-lasting cross protection against heterosubtypic or antigenically distantly related influenza viruses in mice. Mechanistic investigations revealed that DelNS1-LAIVs induce cross protective neutralizing antibody and CD8 and CD4 T cell immunities. Importantly, it has been shown that DelNS1-LAIV can be used to enhance specific anti-influenza immunity through expression of additional antigens from the deleted-NS1 site. Generation of DelNS1 viruses which are nonpathogenic and able to grow in vaccine-producing systems is an important strategy for making highly immunogenic LAIV vaccines that induce broad cross protective immunity against seasonal and emerging influenza. Current seasonal influenza vaccines are suboptimal and low in immunogenicity and do not provide long-lasting immunity and cross protection against influenza virus strains that have antigenically drifted. More-effective influenza vaccines which can induce both humoral immunity and T cell immunity are needed. The NS1 protein of influenza virus is a virulence element and the critical factor for regulation of the host immune response during virus infection. Deletion of the NS1 protein is a strategy to make an optimal LAIV vaccine. However, DelNS1 viruses are very difficult to grow in regular vaccine-producing systems, hampering the application of DelNS1 LAIV vaccines in humans. We have generated a panel of both influenza A and influenza B DelNS1 LAIVs which are able to grow in regular vaccine-producing cells. These DelNS1 LAIV vaccines are completely nonpathogenic, exhibit potent and long-lasting immunity, and can be used to express extra viral antigen to induce cross protective immunity against seasonal and emerging influenza."

There is increasing evidence that higher flavonoid intake may be causally linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases. The bioactivity and bioavailability of many dietary flavonoids can be influenced by gastrointestinal microbiome metabolism. However, the role that habitual flavonoid intake plays in shaping the human gut microbiome is poorly understood. We describe an application of an ecosystem-based analytic approach to nutritional, microbiome, and questionnaire data from a cohort of more than 240 generally healthy adult males to assess the role of dietary flavonoid compounds in driving patterns of microbial community assembly. We identified six subclass-specific microbial communities (SMCs) uniquely and independently associated with intakes of the six flavonoid subclasses.  was positively associated with intakes of flavonol and flavanone, and  was positively associated with intakes of flavonols and flavanol monomers. In contrast, for nearly all flavonoid subclasses,  was inversely associated with subclass consumption. Consuming tea at least once per week explained 10.4% of the total variance in assembly of the 20 species comprising the flavanol monomer SMC. The novel methodology employed, necessitated by multidimensional microbiome data that consist of nonindependent features that exhibit a wide range of distributions and mean values, addresses a major challenge in our ability to understand associations of the microbiome in a wide range of clinical and epidemiologic settings. Dietary flavonoids, which have been implicated in lowering chronic disease risk and improving blood pressure, represent a diverse group of polyphenolic compounds found in many commonly consumed foods such as tea, red wine, apples, and berries. The bioactivity and bioavailability of more dietary flavonoids can be influenced by gastrointestinal microbiome metabolism. With demonstrated prebiotic and antimicrobial effects in  and in animal models, it is surprising that there are not many human studies investigating the role dietary flavonoids play in shaping the gastrointestinal microbiome. Our analysis revealed patterns of community assembly that uniquely and independently characterize an individual's exposure to various flavonoid compounds. Furthermore, this study confirmed, independent from effects of other dietary and lifestyle factors included in the multivariate-adjusted model, that flavonoid intake is associated with microbial community assembly."

While it is widely accepted that cobamide-dependent organisms require specific cobamides for their metabolism, the biochemical mechanisms that make cobamides functionally distinct are largely unknown. Here, we examine the effects of cobamide structural variation on a model cobamide-dependent enzyme, methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) mutase (MCM). The  binding affinity of MCM for cobamides can be dramatically influenced by small changes in the structure of the lower ligand of the cobamide, and binding selectivity differs between bacterial orthologs of MCM. In contrast, variations in the lower ligand have minor effects on MCM catalysis. Bacterial growth assays demonstrate that cobamide requirements of MCM  largely correlate with  cobamide dependence. This result underscores the importance of enzyme selectivity in the cobamide-dependent physiology of bacteria. Cobamides, including vitamin B, are enzyme cofactors used by organisms in all domains of life. Cobamides are structurally diverse, and microbial growth and metabolism vary based on cobamide structure. Understanding cobamide preference in microorganisms is important given that cobamides are widely used and appear to mediate microbial interactions in host-associated and aquatic environments. Until now, the biochemical basis for cobamide preferences was largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the structural diversity of cobamides on a model cobamide-dependent enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM). We found that very small changes in cobamide structure could dramatically affect the binding affinity of cobamides to MCM. Strikingly, cobamide-dependent growth of a model bacterium, , largely correlated with the cofactor binding selectivity of  MCM, emphasizing the importance of cobamide-dependent enzyme selectivity in bacterial growth and cobamide-mediated microbial interactions."

            "#text": "Due to their comparatively small genome size and short generation time, fungi are exquisite model systems to study eukaryotic genome evolution. Powdery mildew fungi present an exceptional case because of their strict host dependency (termed obligate biotrophy) and the atypical size of their genomes (>100 Mb). This size expansion is largely due to the pervasiveness of transposable elements on 70% of the genome and is associated with the loss of multiple conserved ascomycete genes required for a free-living lifestyle. To date, little is known about the mechanisms that drove these changes, and information on ancestral powdery mildew genomes is lacking. We report genome analysis of the early-diverged and exclusively sexually reproducing powdery mildew fungus , which we performed on the basis of a natural leaf epiphytic metapopulation sample. In contrast to other sequenced species of this taxonomic group, the assembled  draft genome is surprisingly small (<30 Mb), has a higher content of conserved ascomycete genes, and is sparsely equipped with transposons (<10%), despite the conserved absence of a common defense mechanism involved in constraining repetitive elements. We speculate that transposable element spread might have been limited by this pathogen's unique reproduction strategy and host features and further hypothesize that the loss of conserved ascomycete genes may promote the evolutionary isolation and host niche specialization of powdery mildew fungi. Limitations associated with this evolutionary trajectory might have been in part counteracted by the evolution of plastic, transposon-rich genomes and/or the expansion of gene families encoding secreted virulence proteins. Powdery mildew fungi are widespread and agronomically relevant phytopathogens causing major yield losses. Their genomes have disproportionately large numbers of mobile genetic elements, and they have experienced a significant loss of highly conserved fungal genes. In order to learn more about the evolutionary history of this fungal group, we explored the genome of an Asian oak tree pathogen, , a species that diverged early during evolution from the remaining powdery mildew fungi. We found that the  draft genome is comparatively compact, has a low number of protein-coding genes, and, despite the absence of a dedicated genome defense system, lacks the massive proliferation of repetitive sequences. Based on these findings, we infer an evolutionary trajectory that shaped the genomes of powdery mildew fungi."

            "#text": "GII.4 noroviruses are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis. Their dominance has been partially explained by the continuous emergence of antigenically distinct variants. To gain insights into the mechanisms of viral emergence and population dynamics of GII.4 noroviruses, we performed large-scale genomics, structural, and mutational analyses of the viral capsid protein (VP1). GII.4 noroviruses exhibited a periodic replacement of predominant variants with accumulation of amino acid substitutions. Genomic analyses revealed (i) a large proportion (87%) of conserved residues; (ii) variable residues that map on the previously determined antigenic sites; and (iii) variable residues that map outside the antigenic sites. Residues in the third pattern category formed motifs on the surface of VP1, which suggested extensions of previously predicted and new uncharacterized antigenic sites. The role of two motifs (C and G) in the antigenic makeup of the GII.4 capsid protein was confirmed with monoclonal antibodies and carbohydrate blocking assays. Amino acid profiles from antigenic sites (A, C, D, E, and G) correlated with the circulation patterns of GII.4 variants, with three of them (A, C, and G) containing residues (352, 357, 368, and 378) linked with the diversifying selective pressure on the emergence of new GII.4 variants. Notably, the emergence of each variant was followed by stochastic diversification with minimal changes that did not progress toward the next variant. This report provides a methodological framework for antigenic characterization of viruses and expands our understanding of the dynamics of GII.4 noroviruses and could facilitate the design of cross-reactive vaccines. Noroviruses are an important cause of viral gastroenteritis around the world. An obstacle delaying the development of norovirus vaccines is inadequate understanding of the role of norovirus diversity in immunity. Using a population genomics approach, we identified new residues on the viral capsid protein (VP1) from GII.4 noroviruses, the predominant genotype, that appear to be involved in the emergence and antigenic topology of GII.4 variants. Careful monitoring of the substitutions in those residues involved in the diversification and emergence of new viruses could help in the early detection of future novel variants with pandemic potential. Therefore, this novel information on the antigenic diversification could facilitate GII.4 norovirus vaccine design."

            "#text": "While most bacterial and archaeal taxa living in surface soils remain undescribed, this problem is exacerbated in deeper soils, owing to the unique oligotrophic conditions found in the subsurface. Additionally, previous studies of soil microbiomes have focused almost exclusively on surface soils, even though the microbes living in deeper soils also play critical roles in a wide range of biogeochemical processes. We examined soils collected from 20 distinct profiles across the United States to characterize the bacterial and archaeal communities that live in subsurface soils and to determine whether there are consistent changes in soil microbial communities with depth across a wide range of soil and environmental conditions. We found that bacterial and archaeal diversity generally decreased with depth, as did the degree of similarity of microbial communities to those found in surface horizons. We observed five phyla that consistently increased in relative abundance with depth across our soil profiles: , , , and candidate phyla GAL15 and  (formerly AD3). Leveraging the unusually high abundance of  at depth, we assembled genomes representative of this candidate phylum and identified traits that are likely to be beneficial in low-nutrient environments, including the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, the potential to use carbon monoxide (CO) as a supplemental energy source, and the ability to form spores. Together these attributes likely allow members of the candidate phylum  to flourish in deeper soils and provide insight into the survival and growth strategies employed by the microbes that thrive in oligotrophic soil environments. Soil profiles are rarely homogeneous. Resource availability and microbial abundances typically decrease with soil depth, but microbes found in deeper horizons are still important components of terrestrial ecosystems. By studying 20 soil profiles across the United States, we documented consistent changes in soil bacterial and archaeal communities with depth. Deeper soils harbored communities distinct from those of the more commonly studied surface horizons. Most notably, we found that the candidate phylum  (formerly AD3) was often dominant in subsurface soils, and we used genomes from uncultivated members of this group to identify why these taxa are able to thrive in such resource-limited environments. Simply digging deeper into soil can reveal a surprising number of novel microbes with unique adaptations to oligotrophic subsurface conditions."

            "#text": "We previously attempted to establish a reporter influenza virus by inserting the gene for the Venus fluorescent protein into the NS segment of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8, H1N1) virus to yield WT-Venus-PR8. Although the inserted Venus gene was deleted during serial passages of WT-Venus-PR8, we discovered that the PB2-E712D mutation stabilizes the Venus gene. Here, we explored the mechanisms by which Venus gene deletion occurs and how the polymerase mutation stabilizes the Venus gene. Deep sequencing analysis revealed that PB2-E712D does not cause an appreciable change in the mutation rate, suggesting that the stability of the Venus gene is not affected by polymerase fidelity. We found by using quantitative real-time PCR that WT-Venus-PR8 induces high-level interferon beta (IFN-β) expression. The induction of IFN-β expression seemed to result from the reduced transcription/replication efficiency of the modified NS segment in WT-Venus-PR8. In contrast, the transcription/replication efficiency of the modified NS segment was enhanced by the PB2-E712D mutation. Loss of the Venus gene in WT-Venus-PR8 appeared to be caused by internal deletions in the NS segment. Moreover, to further our understanding of the Venus stabilization mechanisms, we identified additional amino acid mutations in the virus polymerase complex that stabilize the Venus gene. We found that some of these amino acids are located near the template exit or the product exit of the viral polymerase, suggesting that these amino acids contribute to the stability of the Venus gene by affecting the binding affinity between the polymerase complex and the RNA template and product. The reverse genetics method of influenza virus generation has enabled us to generate recombinant viruses bearing modified viral proteins. Recombinant influenza viruses expressing foreign genes have become useful tools in basic research, and such viruses can be utilized as efficient virus vectors or multivalent vaccines. However, the insertion of a foreign gene into the influenza virus genome often impairs virus replication, and the inserted genes are unstable. Elucidation of the mechanisms of foreign gene stabilization will help us to establish useful recombinant influenza viruses."

            "#text": "Skeletal muscle function is compromised in many illnesses, including chronic infections. The  quorum sensing (QS) signal, 2-amino acetophenone (2-AA), is produced during acute and chronic infections and excreted in human tissues, including the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. We have shown that 2-AA facilitates pathogen persistence, likely via its ability to promote the formation of bacterial persister cells, and that it acts as an interkingdom immunomodulatory signal that epigenetically reprograms innate immune functions. Moreover, 2-AA compromises muscle contractility and impacts the expression of genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis in skeletal muscle and in mitochondrial functions. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of 2-AA's impairment of skeletal muscle function and ROS homeostasis. Murine  and differentiated C2C12 myotube cell studies showed that 2-AA promotes ROS generation in skeletal muscle via the modulation of xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, NAD(P)H oxidase2 (NOX2) protein level, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. ROS accumulation triggers the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), likely upstream of the observed locations of induction of ubiquitin ligases Muscle RING Finger 1 (MuRF1) and Muscle Atrophy F-box (MAFbx), and induces autophagy-related proteins. The protein-level perturbation in skeletal muscle of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1), and uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) is rescued by the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). Together, these results unveil a novel form of action of a QS bacterial molecule and provide molecular insights into the 2-AA-mediated skeletal muscle dysfunction caused by , a bacterium that is resistant to treatment, causes serious acute, persistent, and relapsing infections in humans. There is increasing evidence that bacterial excreted small molecules play a critical role during infection. We have shown that a quorum sensing (QS)-regulated excreted small molecule, 2-AA, which is abundantly produced by , promotes persistent infections, dampens host inflammation, and triggers mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. QS is a cell-to-cell communication system utilized by bacteria to promote collective behaviors. The significance of our study in identifying a mechanism that leads to skeletal muscle dysfunction, via the action of a QS molecule, is that it may open new avenues in the control of muscle loss as a result of infection and sepsis. Given that QS is a common characteristic of prokaryotes, it is possible that 2-AA-like molecules promoting similar effects may exist in other pathogens."

An aerobic expansion of colibactin-producing  was required for the cancer-inducing activity of this pathobiont in a mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer formation. We conclude that increased epithelial oxygenation in the colon is associated with an expansion of a prooncogenic driver species, thereby increasing the cancer-inducing activity of the microbiota. One of the environmental factors important for colorectal cancer formation is the gut microbiota, but the habitat filters that control its cancer-inducing activity remain unknown. Here, we show that chemically induced colitis elevates epithelial oxygenation in the colon, thereby driving an expansion of colibactin-producing , a prooncogenic driver species. These data suggest that elevated epithelial oxygenation is a potential risk factor for colorectal cancer formation because the consequent changes in the gut habitat escalate the cancer-inducing activity of the microbiota."

Since the 1950s, researchers have combined first principles and data to predict the optimal timing of life history transitions. Recently, a striking mystery has emerged. Such transitions can be shaped by a completely different branch of the tree of life: species in the microbiome. Probing these interactions using testable predictions from evolutionary theory could illuminate whether and how host-microbiome integrated life histories can evolve and be maintained. Beyond advancing fundamental science, this research program could yield important applications. In an age of microbiome engineering, understanding the contexts that lead to microbiota signaling shaping ontogeny could offer novel mechanisms for manipulations to increase yield in agriculture by manipulating plant responses to stressful environments, or to reduce pathogen transmission by affecting vector efficiency. We combine theory and evidence to illuminate the essential questions underlying the existence of crobiome-ependent ntogenetic iming (MiDOT) to fuel research on this emerging topic."

            "#text": "The human fungal commensal  can become a serious opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised hosts. The  cell adhesion protein Als1p is a highly expressed member of a large family of paralogous adhesins. Als1p can mediate binding to epithelial and endothelial cells, is upregulated in infections, and is important for biofilm formation. Als1p includes an amyloid-forming sequence at amino acids 325 to 331, identical to the sequence in the paralogs Als5p and Als3p. Therefore, we mutated Val326 to test whether this sequence is important for activity. Wild-type Als1p (Als1p) and Als1p with the V326N mutation (Als1p) were expressed at similar levels in a  surface display model. Als1p cells adhered to bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated beads similarly to Als1p cells. However, cells displaying Als1p showed visibly smaller aggregates and did not fluoresce in the presence of the amyloid-binding dye Thioflavin-T. A new analysis tool for single-molecule force spectroscopy-derived surface mapping showed that statistically significant force-dependent Als1p clustering occurred in Als1p cells but was absent in Als1p cells. In single-cell force spectroscopy experiments, strong cell-cell adhesion was dependent on an intact amyloid core sequence on both interacting cells. Thus, the major adhesin Als1p interacts through amyloid-like β-aggregation to cluster adhesin molecules in  on the cell surface as well as in  to form cell-cell bonds. Microbial cell surface adhesins control essential processes such as adhesion, colonization, and biofilm formation. In the opportunistic fungal pathogen , the gglutinin-ike equence () gene family encodes eight cell surface glycoproteins that mediate adherence to biotic and abiotic surfaces and cell-cell aggregation. Als proteins are critical for commensalism and virulence. Their activities include attachment and invasion of endothelial and epithelial cells, morphogenesis, and formation of biofilms on host tissue and indwelling medical catheters. At the molecular level, Als5p-mediated cell-cell aggregation is dependent on the formation of amyloid-like nanodomains between Als5p-expressing cells. A single-site mutation to valine 326 abolishes cellular aggregation and amyloid formation. Our results show that the binding characteristics of Als1p follow a mechanistic model similar to Als5p, despite its differential expression and biological roles."

We found host genotype-dependent community shifts in the root and rhizosphere compartments that were mainly confined to bacteria in  or fungi in  mutants, while  and  plants displayed major changes across both microbial kingdoms. We observed in all AM mutant roots an almost complete depletion of a large number of Glomeromycota taxa that was accompanied by a concomitant enrichment of Helotiales and Nectriaceae fungi, suggesting compensatory niche replacement within the fungal community. A subset of Glomeromycota whose colonization is strictly dependent on the common symbiosis pathway was retained in  mutants, indicating that  is dispensable for intraradical colonization by some Glomeromycota fungi. However, intraradical colonization by bacteria belonging to the  and  is dependent on AM root infection, revealing a microbial interkingdom interaction. Despite the overall robustness of the bacterial root microbiota against major changes in the composition of root-associated fungal assemblages, bacterial and fungal cooccurrence network analysis demonstrates that simultaneous disruption of AM and rhizobium symbiosis increases the connectivity among taxa of the bacterial root microbiota. Our findings imply a broad role for  symbiosis genes in structuring the root microbiota and identify unexpected microbial interkingdom interactions between root symbionts and commensal communities. Studies on symbiosis genes in plants typically focus on binary interactions between roots and soilborne nitrogen-fixing rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungi in laboratory environments. We utilized wild type and symbiosis mutants of a model legume, grown in natural soil, in which bacterial, fungal, or both symbioses are impaired to examine potential interactions between the symbionts and commensal microorganisms of the root microbiota when grown in natural soil. This revealed microbial interkingdom interactions between the root symbionts and fungal as well as bacterial commensal communities. Nevertheless, the bacterial root microbiota remains largely robust when fungal symbiosis is impaired. Our work implies a broad role for host symbiosis genes in structuring the root microbiota of legumes."

Recent studies have shown that clonal expansion of latently infected cells without viral reactivation is an important phenomenon that maintains the long-term stability of the reservoir, yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we report that a subset of CD4 T cells, characterized by CD161 expression on the surface, is highly permissive for HIV-1 infection. These cells possess a significantly higher survival and proliferative capacity than their CD161-negative counterparts. More importantly, we found that these cells harbor HIV-1 DNA and replication-competent latent viruses at a significantly higher frequency. By using massive single-genome proviral sequencing from ART-suppressed individuals, we confirm that CD161 CD4 T cells contain remarkably more identical proviral sequences, indicating clonal expansion of the viral genome in these cells. Taking the results together, our study identifies infected CD161 CD4 T cells to be a critical force driving the clonal expansion of the HIV-1 latent reservoir, providing a novel mechanism for the long-term stability of HIV-1 latency. The latent reservoir continues to be the major obstacle to curing HIV-1 infection. The clonal expansion of latently infected cells adds another layer maintaining the long-term stability of the reservoir, but its mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that CD161 CD4 T cells serve as an important compartment of the HIV-1 latent reservoir and contain a significant amount of clonally expanded proviruses. In our study, we describe a feasible strategy that may reduce the size of the latent reservoir to a certain extent by counterbalancing the repopulation and dissemination of latently infected cells."

            "#text": "Understanding the mechanisms behind host cell invasion by  remains a major hurdle to developing antimalarial therapeutics that target the asexual cycle and the symptomatic stage of malaria. Host cell entry is enabled by a multitude of precisely timed and tightly regulated receptor-ligand interactions. Cyclic nucleotide signaling has been implicated in regulating parasite invasion, and an important downstream effector of the cAMP-signaling pathway is protein kinase A (PKA), a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. There is increasing evidence that  PKA (PfPKA) is responsible for phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of  apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) at Ser610, a cAMP-dependent event that is crucial for successful parasite invasion. In the present study, CRISPR-Cas9 and conditional gene deletion (dimerizable cre) technologies were implemented to generate a  parasite line in which expression of the catalytic subunit of PfPKA (PfPKAc) is under conditional control, demonstrating highly efficient dimerizable Cre recombinase (DiCre)-mediated gene excision and complete knockdown of protein expression. Parasites lacking PfPKAc show severely reduced growth after one intraerythrocytic growth cycle and are deficient in host cell invasion, as highlighted by live-imaging experiments. Furthermore, PfPKAc-deficient parasites are unable to phosphorylate PfAMA1 at Ser610. This work not only identifies an essential role for PfPKAc in the  asexual life cycle but also confirms that PfPKAc is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating PfAMA1 Ser610. Malaria continues to present a major global health burden, particularly in low-resource countries. , the parasite responsible for the most severe form of malaria, causes disease through rapid and repeated rounds of invasion and replication within red blood cells. Invasion into red blood cells is essential for  survival, and the molecular events mediating this process have gained much attention as potential therapeutic targets. With no effective vaccine available, and with the emergence of resistance to antimalarials, there is an urgent need for the development of new therapeutics. Our research has used genetic techniques to provide evidence of an essential protein kinase involved in  invasion. Our work adds to the current understanding of parasite signaling processes required for invasion, highlighting PKA as a potential drug target to inhibit invasion for the treatment of malaria."

There are two AHL regulatory systems: the LasR-LasI circuit and the RhlR-RhlI system. We mapped transcription termination sites affected by AHL QS in , and in doing so we identified AHL-regulated small RNAs (sRNAs). Of interest, we noted that one particular sRNA was located within the  locus. We found that , which encodes the enzyme that produces the AHL -butanoyl-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), is controlled by a 5' untranslated region (UTR)-derived sRNA we name RhlS. We also identified an antisense RNA encoded opposite the beginning of the  open reading frame, which we name asRhlS. RhlS accumulates as wild-type cells enter stationary phase and is required for the production of normal levels of C4-HSL through activation of  translation. RhlS also directly posttranscriptionally regulates at least one other unlinked gene, . The asRhlS appears to be expressed at maximal levels during logarithmic growth, and we suggest RhlS may act antagonistically to the asRhlS to regulate  translation. The -encoded sRNAs represent a novel aspect of RNA-mediated tuning of  QS. The opportunistic human pathogen  possesses multiple quorum sensing systems that regulate and coordinate production of virulence factors and adaptation to different environments. Despite extensive research, the regulatory elements that play a role in this complex network are still not fully understood. By using several RNA sequencing techniques, we were able to identify a small regulatory RNA we named RhlS. RhlS increases translation of RhlI, a key enzyme in the quorum sensing pathway, and represses the  mRNA encoding one of the siderophore pyoverdine receptors. Our results highlight a new regulatory layer of  quorum sensing and contribute to the growing understanding of the role regulatory RNAs play in bacterial physiology."

The effects of diet are often related to an individual's specific microbiota composition. The close links between health, diet, and gut microbiota are illustrated in a new mouse model of sepsis where the combination of a high-fat/low-fiber Western diet, antibiotics, and surgery promotes the development of lethal sepsis. Diet can also influence infection via the gut microbiota beyond sepsis. Future studies with this model may inform the use of microbiota analysis and personalized diets to protect surgery patients from infection and sepsis.",

This poses a significant challenge for the host to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies. In , we show that a mechanism to circumvent this challenge is to elicit antibodies to cryptic epitopes that are not under immune pressure. We previously discovered that antibodies to the  invasion protein, PvDBP, cross-react with  VAR2CSA, a distantly related virulence factor that mediates placental malaria. Here, we describe the molecular mechanism underlying this cross-species immunity. We identified an epitope in subdomain 1 (SD1) within the Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain of PvDBP that gives rise to cross-reactive antibodies to VAR2CSA and show that human antibodies affinity purified against a synthetic SD1 peptide block parasite adhesion to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA)  The epitope in SD1 is subdominant and highly conserved in PvDBP, and in turn, SD1 antibodies target cryptic epitopes in  VAR2CSA. The epitopes in VAR2CSA recognized by vivax-derived SD1 antibodies (of human and mouse origin) are distinct from those recognized by VAR2CSA immune serum. We mapped two peptides in the DBL5ε domain of VAR2CSA that are recognized by SD1 antibodies. Both peptides map to regions outside the immunodominant sites, and antibodies to these peptides are not elicited following immunization with VAR2CSA or natural infection with  in pregnancy, consistent with the cryptic nature of these target epitopes. In this work, we describe a molecular mechanism of heterologous immunity between two distant species of  Our results suggest a mechanism that subverts the classic parasite strategy of presenting highly polymorphic epitopes in surface antigens to evade immunity to that parasite. This alternative immune pathway can be exploited to protect pregnant women from falciparum placental malaria by designing vaccines to cryptic epitopes that elicit broadly inhibitory antibodies against variant parasite strains."

            "#text": "The microbiome is important to all animals, including poultry, playing a critical role in health and performance. Low-dose antibiotics have historically been used to modulate food production animals and their microbiome. Identifying alternatives to antibiotics conferring similar modulatory properties has been elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine if a host-tailored probiotic could recapitulate effects of a low-dose antibiotic on host response and the developing microbiome. Over 13 days of life, turkey poults were supplemented continuously with a low-dose antibiotic or oral supplementation of a prebiotic with or without two different probiotics (8 cage units,  = 80 per group). Gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal communities of poults were characterized by 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Localized and systemic host gene expression was assessed using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), kinase activity was assessed by avian-specific kinome peptide arrays, and performance parameters were assessed. We found that development of the early-life microbiome of turkey poults was tightly ordered in a tissue- and time-specific manner. Low-dose antibiotic and turkey-tailored probiotic supplementation, but not nontailored probiotic supplementation, elicited similar shifts in overall microbiome composition during development compared to controls. Treatment-induced bacterial changes were accompanied by parallel shifts in the fungal community and host gene expression and enhanced performance metrics. These results were validated in pen trials that identified further additive effects of the turkey-tailored probiotic combined with different prebiotics. Alternative approaches to low-dose antibiotic use in poultry are feasible and can be optimized utilizing the indigenous poultry microbiome. Similar approaches may also be beneficial for humans. Alternative approaches are greatly needed to reduce the need for antibiotic use in food animal production. This study utilized a pipeline for the development of a host-tailored probiotic to enhance performance in commercial turkeys and modulate their microbiota, similar to the effects of low-dose antibiotic administration. We determined that a host-tailored probiotic, developed in the context of the commercial turkey gut microbiome, was more effective at modulating these parameters than a nontailored probiotic cocktail. Furthermore, the host-tailored probiotic mimicked many of the effects of a low-dose antibiotic growth promoter. Surprisingly, the effects of the antibiotic growth promoter and host-tailored probiotic were observed across kingdoms, illustrating the coordinated interkingdom effects of these approaches. This work suggests that tailored approaches to probiotic development hold promise for modulating the avian host and its microbiota."

            "#text": "The reverse transsulfuration pathway is the major route for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. The role of this metabolic pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine metabolism by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a metabolic pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the metabolism of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages."

            "#text": "For free-living bacteria and archaea, the equivalent of the biological species concept does not exist, creating several obstacles to the study of the processes contributing to microbial diversification. These obstacles are particularly high in soil, where high bacterial diversity inhibits the study of closely related genotypes and therefore the factors structuring microbial populations. Here, we isolated strains within a single  ecotype from surface soil (leaf litter) across a regional climate gradient and investigated the phylogenetic structure, recombination, and flexible gene content of this genomic diversity to infer patterns of gene flow. Our results indicate that microbial populations are delineated by gene flow discontinuities, with distinct populations cooccurring at multiple sites. Bacterial population structure was further delineated by genomic features allowing for the identification of candidate genes possibly contributing to local adaptation. These results suggest that the genetic structure within this bacterium is maintained both by ecological specialization in localized microenvironments (isolation by environment) and by dispersal limitation between geographic locations (isolation by distance). Due to the promiscuous exchange of genetic material and asexual reproduction, delineating microbial species (and, by extension, populations) remains challenging. Because of this, the vast majority of microbial studies assessing population structure often compare divergent strains from disparate environments under varied selective pressures. Here, we investigated the population structure within a single bacterial ecotype, a unit equivalent to a eukaryotic species, defined as highly clustered genotypic and phenotypic strains with the same ecological niche. Using a combination of genomic and computational analyses, we assessed the phylogenetic structure, extent of recombination, and flexible gene content of this genomic diversity to infer patterns of gene flow. To our knowledge, this study is the first to do so for a dominant soil bacterium. Our results indicate that bacterial soil populations, similarly to those in other environments, are structured by gene flow discontinuities and exhibit distributional patterns consistent with both isolation by distance and isolation by environment. Thus, both dispersal limitation and local environments contribute to the divergence among closely related soil bacteria as observed in macroorganisms."

Although defining the partners in these associations has become easier, assigning function to these relationships often presents a significant challenge. Here, we describe a functional role for a bacterial consortium in a female reproductive organ in the Hawaiian bobtail squid,  Bacteria from the accessory nidamental gland (ANG) are deposited into the egg jelly coat (JC), where they are hypothesized to play a defensive role during embryogenesis. Eggs treated with an antibiotic cocktail developed a microbial biomass primarily composed of the pathogenic fungus  that infiltrated the JC, resulting in severely reduced hatch rates. Experimental manipulation of the eggs demonstrated that the JC was protective against this fungal fouling. A large proportion of the bacterial strains isolated from the ANG or JC inhibited  in culture (87.5%), while a similar proportion of extracts from these strains also exhibited antifungal activity against  and/or the human-pathogenic yeast  (72.7%). Mass spectral network analyses of active extracts from bacterial isolates and egg clutches revealed compounds that may be involved in preventing microbial overgrowth. Several secondary metabolites were identified from ANG/JC bacteria and egg clutches, including the known antimicrobial lincomycin as well as a suite of glycerophosphocholines and mycinamicin-like compounds. These results shed light on a widely distributed but poorly understood symbiosis in cephalopods and offer a new source for exploring bacterial secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity. Organisms must have strategies to ensure successful reproduction. Some animals that deposit eggs protect their embryos from fouling/disease with the help of microorganisms. Although beneficial bacteria are hypothesized to contribute to egg defense in some organisms, the mechanisms of this protection remain largely unknown, with the exception of a few recently described systems. Using both experimental and analytical approaches, we demonstrate that symbiotic bacteria associated with a cephalopod reproductive gland and eggs inhibit fungi. Chemical analyses suggest that these bacteria produce antimicrobial compounds that may prevent overgrowth from fungi and other microorganisms. Given the distribution of these symbiotic glands among many cephalopods, similar defensive relationships may be more common in aquatic environments than previously realized. Such defensive symbioses may also be a rich source for the discovery of new antimicrobial compounds."

Within the CPR,  (BD1-5) are particularly poorly understood due to undersampling and the inherent fragmented nature of available genomes. Here, we report the first closed, curated genome of a gracilibacterium from an enrichment experiment inoculated from the Gulf of Mexico and designed to investigate hydrocarbon degradation. The gracilibacterium rose in abundance after the community switched to dominance by  Notably, we predict that this gracilibacterium completely lacks glycolysis, the pentose phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff pathways. It appears to acquire pyruvate, acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), and oxaloacetate via degradation of externally derived citrate, malate, and amino acids and may use compound interconversion and oxidoreductases to generate and recycle reductive power. The initial genome assembly was fragmented in an unusual gene that is hypervariable within a repeat region. Such extreme local variation is rare but characteristic of genes that confer traits under pressure to diversify within a population. Notably, the four major repeated 9-mer nucleotide sequences all generate a proline-threonine-aspartic acid (PTD) repeat. The genome of an abundant  population has a large extracellular protein that also contains the repeated PTD motif. Although we do not know the host for the BD1-5 cell, the high relative abundance of the  population and the shared surface protein repeat may indicate an association between these bacteria. CPR bacteria are generally predicted to be symbionts due to their extensive biosynthetic deficits. Although monophyletic, they are not monolithic in terms of their lifestyles. The organism described here appears to have evolved an unusual metabolic platform not reliant on glucose or pentose sugars. Its biology appears to be centered around bacterial host-derived compounds and/or cell detritus. Amino acids likely provide building blocks for nucleic acids, peptidoglycan, and protein synthesis. We resolved an unusual repeat region that would be invisible without genome curation. The nucleotide sequence is apparently under strong diversifying selection, but the amino acid sequence is under stabilizing selection. The amino acid repeat also occurs in a surface protein of a coexisting bacterium, suggesting colocation and possibly interdependence."

            "#text": "Transcription of bacterial genes is controlled by the coordinated action of  and -acting regulators. The activity and mode of action of these regulators can reflect different requirements for gene products in different environments. A well-studied example is the regulatory function that integrates the environmental availability of glucose and lactose to control the  operon. Most studies of  operon regulation have focused on a few closely related strains. To determine the range of natural variation in  regulatory function, we introduced a reporter construct into 23 diverse  strains and measured expression with combinations of inducer concentrations. We found a wide range of regulatory functions. Several functions were similar to the one observed in a reference lab strain, whereas others depended weakly on the presence of cAMP. Some characteristics of the regulatory function were explained by the genetic relatedness of strains, indicating that differences varied on relatively short time scales. The regulatory characteristics explained by genetic relatedness were among those that best predicted the initial growth of strains following transition to a lactose environment, suggesting a role for selection. Finally, we transferred the  operon, with the  regulatory gene, from five natural isolate strains into a reference lab strain. The regulatory function of these hybrid strains revealed the effect of local and global regulatory elements in controlling expression. Together, this work demonstrates that regulatory functions can be varied within a species and that there is variation within a species to best match a function to particular environments. The  operon of  is a classic model for studying gene regulation. This study has uncovered features such as the environmental input logic controlling gene expression, as well as gene expression bistability and hysteresis. Most  operon studies have focused on a few lab strains, and it is not known how generally those findings apply to the diversity of  strains. We examined the environmental dependence of  gene regulation in 20 natural isolates of  and found a wide range of regulatory responses. By transferring  genes from natural isolate strains into a common reference strain, we found that regulation depends on both the  genes themselves and on the broader genetic background, indicating potential for still-greater regulatory diversity following horizontal gene transfer. Our results reveal that there is substantial natural variation in the regulation of the  operon and indicate that this variation can be ecologically meaningful."

We analyzed the genomic profiles of carbapenem-nonsusceptible  (CNPA) strains collected from two intensive care units (ICUs) in the national referral hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, where a multifaceted infection control intervention was applied. We used clinical data combined with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of systematically collected CNPA to infer the transmission dynamics of CNPA strains and to characterize their resistome. We found that the number of CNPA transmissions and acquisitions by patients was highly variable over time but that, overall, the rates were not significantly reduced by the intervention. Environmental sources were involved in these transmissions and acquisitions. Four high-risk international CNPA clones (ST235, ST823, ST357, and ST446) dominated, but the distribution of these clones changed significantly after the intervention was implemented. Using resistome analysis, carbapenem resistance was explained by the presence of various carbapenemase-encoding genes (, , and ) and by mutations within the porin OprD. Our results reveal for the first time the dynamics of  antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles in Indonesia and additionally show the utility of WGS in combination with clinical data to evaluate the impact of an infection control intervention. (This study has been registered at www.trialregister.nl under registration no. NTR5541). In low-to-middle-income countries such as Indonesia, work in intensive care units (ICUs) can be hampered by lack of resources. Conducting large epidemiological studies in such settings using genomic tools is rather challenging. Still, we were able to systematically study the transmissions of carbapenem-nonsusceptible strains of  (CNPA) within and between ICUs, before and after an infection control intervention. Our data show the importance of the broad dissemination of the internationally recognized CNPA clones, the relevance of environmental reservoirs, and the mixed effects of the implemented intervention; it led to a profound change in the clonal make-up of CNPA, but it did not reduce the patients' risk of CNPA acquisitions. Thus, CNPA epidemiology in Indonesian ICUs is part of a global expansion of multiple CNPA clones that remains difficult to control by infection prevention measures."

            "#text": "Bats are reservoirs for many RNA viruses that are highly pathogenic in humans yet relatively apathogenic in the natural host. It has been suggested that differences in innate immunity are responsible. The antiviral OAS-RNase L pathway is well characterized in humans, but there is little known about its activation and antiviral activity in bats. During infection, OASs, upon sensing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), produce 2'-5' oligoadenylates (2-5A), leading to activation of RNase L which degrades viral and host RNA, limiting viral replication. Humans encode three active OASs (OAS1 to -3). Analysis of the Egyptian Rousette bat genome combined with mRNA sequencing from bat RoNi/7 cells revealed three homologous OAS proteins. Interferon alpha treatment or viral infection induced all three OAS mRNAs, but RNase L mRNA is constitutively expressed. Sindbis virus (SINV) or vaccinia virus (VACVΔE3L) infection of wild-type (WT) or KO (knockout), -KO, or KO RoNi/7 cells, but not -KO or -KO cells, induces robust RNase L activation. SINV replication is 100- to 200-fold higher in the absence of RNase L or OAS3 than in WT cells. However, -KO had no detectable effect on RNA degradation or replication. Thus, in RoNi/7 bat cells, as in human cells, activation of RNase L during infection and its antiviral activity are dependent primarily on OAS3 while MAVS signaling is not required for the activation of RNase L and restriction of infection. Our findings indicate that OAS proteins serve as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize viral dsRNA and that this pathway is a primary response to virus rather than a secondary effect of interferon signaling. Many RNA viruses that are highly pathogenic in humans are relatively apathogenic in their bat reservoirs, making it important to compare innate immune responses in bats to those well characterized in humans. One such antiviral response is the OAS-RNase L pathway. OASs, upon sensing dsRNA, produce 2-5A, leading to activation of RNase L which degrades viral and host RNA, limiting viral replication. Analysis of Egyptian Rousette bat sequences revealed three OAS genes expressing OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 proteins. Interferon treatment or viral infection induces all three bat OAS mRNAs. In these bat cells as in human cells, RNase L activation and its antiviral activity are dependent primarily on OAS3 while MAVS signaling is not required. Importantly, our findings indicate the OAS-RNase L system is a primary response to virus rather than a secondary effect of interferon signaling and therefore can be activated early in infection or while interferon signaling is antagonized."

            "#text": "Invasive growth in tissues by the human fungal pathogen  is promoted by a switch from budding to hyphal morphogenesis that is stimulated by multiple environmental factors that can vary at different sites of infection. To identify genes that promote invasive growth in the oral cavity to cause oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), we first identified  mutants that failed to invade agar medium. Analysis of nine severely defective mutants in a mouse model of OPC revealed that the strongest defects were seen for the Δ and Δ mutants, which lack amphiphysin proteins needed for endocytosis. The Δ mutants initially adhered to the tongue but failed to invade efficiently and were lost from the oral cavity. Previous studies indicated that Δ mutants formed filamentous hyphae in the kidney albeit with morphological abnormalities, suggesting that the Δ mutants were influenced by factors that vary at different sites of infection. Consistent with this, increasing concentrations of CO, an inducer of hyphal growth that is more abundant in internal organs than air, partially rescued the invasive-growth defects of the Δ mutants  Interestingly, preinduction of the Δ mutants to form hyphae prior to introduction into the oral cavity restored their ability to cause OPC, identifying a key role for endocytosis in initiating invasive hyphal growth. These results highlight the influence of distinct environmental factors in promoting invasive hyphal growth in the oral cavity and indicate that blocking endocytosis could have therapeutic value in preventing the initiation of OPC. Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is a common fungal infection that is associated with severe morbidity. Another concern is that patients at risk for developing OPC often take long courses of antifungal drugs, which can lead to the emergence of drug-resistant  strains. We therefore identified nine mutants with defects in undergoing invasive hyphal growth in the oral cavity, increasing the number of genes known to be involved in OPC by more than 30%. The two strongest mutants, Δ and Δ, have defects in endocytosis. The Δ mutants appear to have a specific defect in initiating invasive growth, as preinducing the cells to form hyphae prior to infection restored their ability to cause OPC. These results indicate that blocking endocytosis could have therapeutic value in preventing the initiation of OPC without leading to development of resistance against drugs currently used to treat fungal infections."

            "#text": "Fungi dominate the recycling of carbon sequestered in woody biomass. This process of organic turnover was first evolved among \"white rot\" fungi that degrade lignin to access carbohydrates and later evolved multiple times toward more efficient strategies to selectively target carbohydrates-\"brown rot.\" The brown rot adaption was often explained by mechanisms to deploy reactive oxygen species (ROS) to oxidatively attack wood structures. However, its genetic basis remains unclear, especially in the context of gene contractions of conventional carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZYs) relative to white rot ancestors. Here, we hypothesized that these apparent gains in brown rot efficiency despite gene losses were due, in part, to upregulation of the retained genes. We applied comparative transcriptomics to multiple species of both rot types grown across a wood wafer to create a gradient of progressive decay and to enable tracking temporal gene expression. Dozens of \"decay-stage-dependent\" ortho-genes were isolated, narrowing a pool of candidate genes with time-dependent regulation unique to brown rot fungi. A broad comparison of the expression timing of CAZY families indicated a temporal regulatory shift of lignocellulose-oxidizing genes toward early stages in brown rot compared to white rot, enabling the segregation of oxidative treatment ahead of hydrolysis. These key brown rot ROS-generating genes with iron ion binding functions were isolated. Moreover, transcription energy was shifted to be invested on the retained GHs in brown rot fungi to strengthen carbohydrate conversion. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that gene regulation shifts played a pivotal role in brown rot adaptation. Fungi dominate the turnover of wood, Earth's largest pool of aboveground terrestrial carbon. Fungi first evolved this capacity by degrading lignin to access and hydrolyze embedded carbohydrates (white rot). Multiple lineages, however, adapted faster reactive oxygen species (ROS) pretreatments to loosen lignocellulose and selectively extract sugars (brown rot). This brown rot \"shortcut\" often coincided with losses (>60%) of conventional lignocellulolytic genes, implying that ROS adaptations supplanted conventional pathways. We used comparative transcriptomics to further pursue brown rot adaptations, which illuminated the clear temporal expression shift of ROS genes, as well as the shift toward synthesizing more GHs in brown rot relative to white rot. These imply that gene regulatory shifts, not simply ROS innovations, were key to brown rot fungal evolution. These results not only reveal an important biological shift among these unique fungi, but they may also illuminate a trait that restricts brown rot fungi to certain ecological niches."

            "#text": "A key mechanism that  uses to achieve multidrug resistance is the expulsion of structurally different antimicrobials by the MtrD multidrug efflux protein. MtrD resembles the homologous  AcrB efflux protein with several common structural features, including an open cleft containing putative access and deep binding pockets proposed to interact with substrates. A highly discriminating  strain, with the MtrD and NorM multidrug efflux pumps inactivated, was constructed and used to confirm and extend the substrate profile of MtrD to include 14 new compounds. The structural basis of substrate interactions with MtrD was interrogated by a combination of long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and docking studies together with site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues. Of the MtrD mutants generated, only one (S611A) retained a wild-type (WT) resistance profile, while others (F136A, F176A, I605A, F610A, F612C, and F623C) showed reduced resistance to different antimicrobial compounds. Docking studies of eight MtrD substrates confirmed that many of the mutated residues play important nonspecific roles in binding to these substrates. Long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of MtrD with its substrate progesterone showed the spontaneous binding of the substrate to the access pocket of the binding cleft and its subsequent penetration into the deep binding pocket, allowing the permeation pathway for a substrate through this important resistance mechanism to be identified. These findings provide a detailed picture of the interaction of MtrD with substrates that can be used as a basis for rational antibiotic and inhibitor design. With over 78 million new infections globally each year, gonorrhea remains a frustratingly common infection. Continuous development and spread of antimicrobial-resistant strains of , the causative agent of gonorrhea, have posed a serious threat to public health. One of the mechanisms in  involved in resistance to multiple drugs is performed by the MtrD multidrug resistance efflux pump. This study demonstrated that the MtrD pump has a broader substrate specificity than previously proposed and identified a cluster of residues important for drug binding and translocation. Additionally, a permeation pathway for the MtrD substrate progesterone actively moving through the protein was determined, revealing key interactions within the putative MtrD drug binding pockets. Identification of functionally important residues and substrate-protein interactions of the MtrD protein is crucial to develop future strategies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea."

While these myeloid cells are poorly infected by cell-free viruses because of the high expression levels of cellular restriction factors such as SAMHD1, we show here that HIV-1 uses a specific and common cell-to-cell fusion mechanism for virus transfer and dissemination from infected T lymphocytes to the target cells of the myeloid lineage, including immature DCs (iDCs), OCs, and macrophages, but not monocytes and mature DCs. The establishment of contacts with infected T cells leads to heterotypic cell fusion for the fast and massive transfer of viral material into OC and iDC targets, which subsequently triggers homotypic fusion with noninfected neighboring OCs and iDCs for virus dissemination. These two cell-to-cell fusion processes are not restricted by SAMHD1 and allow very efficient spreading of virus in myeloid cells, resulting in the formation of highly virus-productive multinucleated giant cells. These results reveal the cellular mechanism for SAMHD1-independent cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1 in myeloid cell targets through the formation of the infected multinucleated giant cells observed  in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues of HIV-1-infected patients. We demonstrate that HIV-1 uses a common two-step cell-to-cell fusion mechanism for massive virus transfer from infected T lymphocytes and dissemination to myeloid target cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages as well as osteoclasts. This cell-to-cell infection process bypasses the restriction imposed by the SAMHD1 host cell restriction factor for HIV-1 replication, leading to the formation of highly virus-productive multinucleated giant cells as observed  in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues of HIV-1-infected patients. Since myeloid cells are emerging as important target cells of HIV-1, these results contribute to a better understanding of the role of these myeloid cells in pathogenesis, including cell-associated virus sexual transmission, cell-to-cell virus spreading, and establishment of long-lived viral tissue reservoirs."

            "#text": "Cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp) is an important transcriptional regulator of  Expression of  increases during pneumonic plague as the pathogen depletes glucose and forms large biofilms within lungs. To better understand control of  Crp, we determined a 1.8-Å crystal structure of the protein-cAMP complex. We found that compared to  Crp, C helix amino acid substitutions in  Crp did not impact the cAMP dependency of Crp to bind DNA promoters. To investigate  Crp-regulated genes during plague pneumonia, we performed RNA sequencing on both wild-type and Δ mutant bacteria growing in planktonic and biofilm states in minimal media with glucose or glycerol.  Crp was found to dramatically alter expression of hundreds of genes in a manner dependent upon carbon source and growth state. Gel shift assays confirmed direct regulation of the  and  promoters, and Crp was then linked to  growth on maltose as a sole carbon source. Iron regulation genes  and  were found to be indirectly regulated by Crp. A new connection between carbon source and quorum sensing was revealed as Crp was found to regulate production of acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) through direct and indirect regulation of genes for AHL synthetases and receptors. AHLs were subsequently identified in the lungs of -infected mice when  expression was highest in  biofilms. Thus, in addition to the well-studied  gene, other Crp-regulated genes likely have important functions during plague infection. Bacterial pathogens have evolved extensive signaling pathways to translate environmental signals into changes in gene expression. While Crp has long been appreciated for its role in regulating metabolism of carbon sources in many bacterial species, transcriptional profiling has revealed that this protein regulates many other aspects of bacterial physiology. The plague pathogen  requires this global regulator to survive in blood, skin, and lungs. During disease progression, this organism adapts to changes within these niches. In addition to regulating genes for metabolism of nonglucose sugars, we found that Crp regulates genes for virulence, metal acquisition, and quorum sensing by direct or indirect mechanisms. Thus, this single transcriptional regulator, which responds to changes in available carbon sources, can regulate multiple critical behaviors for causing disease."

            "#text": "Arrestins, a structurally specialized and functionally diverse group of proteins, are central regulators of adaptive cellular responses in eukaryotes. Previous studies on fungal arrestins have demonstrated their capacity to modulate diverse cellular processes through their adaptor functions, facilitating the localization and function of other proteins. However, the mechanisms by which arrestin-regulated processes are involved in fungal virulence remain unexplored. We have identified a small family of four arrestins, Ali1, Ali2, Ali3, and Ali4, in the human fungal pathogen  Using complementary microscopy, proteomic, and reverse genetics techniques, we have defined a role for Ali1 as a novel contributor to cytokinesis, a fundamental cell cycle-associated process. We observed that Ali1 strongly interacts with proteins involved in lipid synthesis, and that Δ mutant phenotypes are rescued by supplementation with lipid precursors that are used to build cellular membranes. From these data, we hypothesize that Ali1 contributes to cytokinesis by serving as an adaptor protein, facilitating the localization of enzymes that modify the plasma membrane during cell division, specifically the fatty acid synthases Fas1 and Fas2. Finally, we assessed the contributions of the  arrestin family to virulence to better understand the mechanisms by which arrestin-regulated adaptive cellular responses influence fungal infection. We observed that the  arrestin family contributes to virulence, and that the individual arrestin proteins likely fulfill distinct functions that are important for disease progression. To survive under unpredictable conditions, all organisms must adapt to stressors by regulating adaptive cellular responses. Arrestin proteins are conserved regulators of adaptive cellular responses in eukaryotes. Studies that have been limited to mammals and model fungi have demonstrated that the disruption of arrestin-regulated pathways is detrimental for viability. The human fungal pathogen  causes more than 180,000 infection-related deaths annually, especially among immunocompromised patients. In addition to being genetically tractable,  has a small arrestin family of four members, lending itself to a comprehensive characterization of its arrestin family. This study serves as a functional analysis of arrestins in a pathogen, particularly in the context of fungal fitness and virulence. We investigate the functions of one arrestin protein, Ali1, and define its novel contributions to cytokinesis. We additionally explore the virulence contributions of the  arrestin family and find that they contribute to disease establishment and progression."

However, the degree to which similar processes occur with Gram-positive bacteria in the community setting is less well understood. In this study, we traced the recent origins and global spread of a multidrug-resistant, community-associated  lineage from the Indian subcontinent, the Bengal Bay clone (ST772). We generated whole-genome sequence data of 340 isolates from 14 countries, including the first isolates from Bangladesh and India, to reconstruct the evolutionary history and genomic epidemiology of the lineage. Our data show that the clone emerged on the Indian subcontinent in the early 1960s and disseminated rapidly in the 1990s. Short-term outbreaks in community and health care settings occurred following intercontinental transmission, typically associated with travel and family contacts on the subcontinent, but ongoing endemic transmission was uncommon. Acquisition of a multidrug resistance integrated plasmid was instrumental in the emergence of a single dominant and globally disseminated clade in the early 1990s. Phenotypic data on biofilm, growth, and toxicity point to antimicrobial resistance as the driving force in the evolution of ST772. The Bengal Bay clone therefore combines the multidrug resistance of traditional health care-associated clones with the epidemiological transmission of community-associated methicillin-resistant  (MRSA). Our study demonstrates the importance of whole-genome sequencing for tracking the evolution of emerging and resistant pathogens. It provides a critical framework for ongoing surveillance of the clone on the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere. The Bengal Bay clone (ST772) is a community-associated and multidrug-resistant  lineage first isolated from Bangladesh and India in 2004. In this study, we showed that the Bengal Bay clone emerged from a virulent progenitor circulating on the Indian subcontinent. Its subsequent global transmission was associated with travel or family contact in the region. ST772 progressively acquired specific resistance elements at limited cost to its fitness and continues to be exported globally, resulting in small-scale community and health care outbreaks. The Bengal Bay clone therefore combines the virulence potential and epidemiology of community-associated clones with the multidrug resistance of health care-associated  lineages. This study demonstrates the importance of whole-genome sequencing for the surveillance of highly antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which may emerge in the community setting of regions with poor antibiotic stewardship and rapidly spread into hospitals and communities across the world."

These infections are resilient and difficult to eradicate, as the bacteria form biofilm, a community of bacteria held together by an extracellular matrix. Compared to bacteria that are planktonic, bacteria in a biofilm are more resistant to antibiotics. The mechanism behind how bacteria develop this resistance and establish a chronic infection is unknown. We demonstrate that , a toxin-antitoxin gene, inhibits biofilm formation and promotes biofilm antibiotic tolerance which allows  to transition from an acute to chronic infection that cannot be eradicated with antibiotics but is less virulent. This gene not only makes the bacteria more tolerant to antibiotics but makes the bacteria more tolerant to the host."

Although the symbiont has been studied in detail on the molecular level, such analyses were unavailable for the animal host, because sequence information was lacking. To identify host-symbiont interaction mechanisms, we therefore sequenced the  transcriptome, which served as a basis for comparative metaproteomic analyses of symbiont-containing versus symbiont-free tissues, both under energy-rich and energy-limited conditions. Our results suggest that metabolic interactions include nutrient allocation from symbiont to host by symbiont digestion and substrate transfer to the symbiont by abundant host proteins. We furthermore propose that  maintains its symbiont by protecting the bacteria from oxidative damage while also exerting symbiont population control. Eukaryote-like symbiont proteins might facilitate intracellular symbiont persistence. Energy limitation apparently leads to reduced symbiont biomass and increased symbiont digestion. Our study provides unprecedented insights into host-microbe interactions that shape this highly efficient symbiosis. All animals are associated with microorganisms; hence, host-microbe interactions are of fundamental importance for life on earth. However, we know little about the molecular basis of these interactions. Therefore, we studied the deep-sea  symbiosis, a model association in which the tubeworm host is associated with only one phylotype of endosymbiotic bacteria and completely depends on this sulfur-oxidizing symbiont for nutrition. Using a metaproteomics approach, we identified both metabolic interaction processes, such as substrate transfer between the two partners, and interactions that serve to maintain the symbiotic balance, e.g., host efforts to control the symbiont population or symbiont strategies to modulate these host efforts. We suggest that these interactions are essential principles of mutualistic animal-microbe associations."

Previously, we have shown that chitosan is a critical component of the cryptococcal cell wall and is required for survival in the mammalian host and that chitosan deficiency results in rapid clearance from the mammalian host. We had also identified several specific proteins that were required for chitosan biosynthesis, and we hypothesize that screening for compounds that inhibit chitosan biosynthesis would identify additional genes/proteins that influence chitosan biosynthesis. To identify these compounds, we developed a robust and novel cell-based flow cytometry screening method to identify small-molecule inhibitors of chitosan production. We screened the ICCB Known Bioactives library and identified 8 compounds that reduced chitosan in  We used flow cytometry-based counterscreens and confirmatory screens, followed by a biochemical secondary screen to refine our primary screening hits to 2 confirmed hits. One of the confirmed hits that reduced chitosan content was the aminoalkylindole BML-190, a known inverse agonist of mammalian cannabinoid receptors. We demonstrated that BML-190 likely targets the  G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr4 and, via the cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, contributes to an intracellular accumulation of cAMP that results in decreased chitosan.

The dysfunction of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism has been observed clinically in association with accelerated HIV-1 pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, is activated by Trp metabolites to promote HIV-1 infection and reactivation. AHR directly binds to the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (5'-LTR) at the molecular level to activate viral transcription and infection, and AHR activation by Trp metabolites increases its nuclear translocation and association with the HIV 5'-LTR; moreover, the binding of AHR with HIV-1 Tat facilitates the recruitment of positive transcription factors to viral promoters. These findings not only elucidate a previously unappreciated mechanism through which cellular Trp metabolites affect HIV pathogenesis but also suggest that a downstream target AHR may be a potential target for modulating HIV-1 infection.

Most virulent  strains encode two type III secretion systems (T3SS1 and T3SS2); however, the roles they and their translocated effectors play in causing intestinal disease remain unclear. While studies have identified T3SS1 effectors as responsible for killing epithelial cells in culture, the T3SS2 effectors caused massive epithelial cell disruption in a rabbit ileal loop model. Additional models are thus needed to clarify the pathogen-host interactions that drive -associated gastroenteritis. Germfree mice were infected with a pathogenic clinical isolate of , RIMD2210633 (RIMD). The pathogen was found to adhere to as well as invade the cecal mucosa, accompanied by severe inflammation and dramatic mucosal damage, including widespread sloughing of infected epithelial cells. Mice infected with a  strain lacking the T3SS1 (POR2) also developed severe pathology, similar to that seen with RIMD. In contrast, the  strain (POR3) appeared unable to invade the intestinal mucosa or cause any mucosal pathology. Confirming a role for TS332 effectors, a strain expressing the T3SS2 but lacking VopC (POR2), a T3SS2 effector implicated in epithelial cell invasion in culture, was strongly attenuated in invading the intestinal mucosa and in causing gastroenteritis, although infection with this mutant resulted in more pathology than the  strain. We thus present an experimental system that enables further characterization of T3SS effectors as well as the corresponding host inflammatory response involved in the gastroenteritis caused by invasive  causes severe gastroenteritis following consumption of contaminated seafood. Global warming has allowed this pathogen to spread worldwide, contributing to recent outbreaks. Clinical isolates are known to harbor an array of virulence factors, including T3SS1 and T3SS2; however, the precise role these systems play in intestinal disease remains unclear. There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of how  infects hosts and causes disease. We present a novel mouse model for this facultative intracellular pathogen and observe that the T3SS2 is essential to pathogenicity. Moreover, we show that the T3SS2 effector VopC, previously shown to be a Rac and Cdc42 deamidase that facilitates bacterial uptake by nonphagocytic cells, also plays a key role in the ability of  to invade the intestinal mucosa and cause gastroenteritis. This experimental model thus provides a valuable tool for future elucidation of virulence mechanisms used by this facultative intracellular pathogen during  infection."

            "#text": "Microorganisms are found everywhere and have critical roles in most ecosystems, but compared to plants and animals, little is known about their temporal dynamics. Here, we investigated the temporal stability of bacterial and fungal communities in the soil and how their temporal variation varies between grasses and forb species. We established 30 outdoor mesocosms consisting of six plant monocultures and followed microbial communities for an entire year in these soils. We demonstrate that bacterial communities vary greatly over time and that turnover plays an important role in shaping microbial communities. We further show that bacterial communities rapidly shift from one state to another and that this is related to changes in the relative contribution of certain taxa rather than to extinction. Fungal soil communities are more stable over time, and a large part of the variation can be explained by plant species and by whether they are grasses or forbs. Our findings show that the soil bacterial community is shaped by time, while plant group and plant species-specific effects drive soil fungal communities. This has important implications for plant-soil research and highlights that temporal dynamics of soil communities cannot be ignored in studies on plant-soil feedback and microbial community composition and function. Our findings highlight how soil fungal and bacterial communities respond to time, season, and plant species identity. We found that succession shapes the soil bacterial community, while plant species and the type of plant species that grows in the soil drive the assembly of soil fungal communities. Future research on the effects of plants on soil microbes should take into consideration the relative roles of both time and plant growth on creating soil legacies that impact future plants growing in the soil. Understanding the temporal (in)stability of microbial communities in soils will be crucial for predicting soil microbial composition and functioning, especially as plant species compositions will shift with global climatic changes and land-use alterations. As fungal and bacterial communities respond to different environmental cues, our study also highlights that the selection of study organisms to answer specific ecological questions is not trivial and that the timing of sampling can greatly affect the conclusions made from these studies."

However, determining how bacteria respond to these microenvironments has been limited by a lack of tools to study bacterial functions at the relevant spatial scales  Here, we report the application of the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) v3.0 to provide analog mRNA relative quantitation of  single cells as a step toward this end. To assess the potential for this method to be applied to bacterial populations, we visualized the expression of genes needed for the production of alginate () and the dissimilatory nitrate reductase () at single-cell resolution within laboratory-grown aggregates. After validating new HCR probes, we quantified  and  expression across microenvironmental gradients within both single aggregates and aggregate populations using the agar block biofilm assay (ABBA). For mucoid and nonmucoid ABBA populations,  was expressed in hypoxic and anoxic regions, while alginate expression was restricted to the hypoxic zone (∼40 to 200 μM O). Within individual aggregates, surface-adjacent cells expressed alginate genes at higher levels than interior cells, revealing that alginate expression is not constitutive in mucoid  but instead varies with oxygen availability. These results establish HCR v3.0 as a versatile and robust tool to resolve subtle differences in gene expression at spatial scales relevant to microbial assemblages. This advance has the potential to enable quantitative studies of microbial gene expression in diverse contexts, including pathogen activities during infections. A goal for microbial ecophysiological research is to reveal microbial activities in natural environments, including sediments, soils, or infected human tissues. Here, we report the application of the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) v3.0 to quantitatively measure microbial gene expression  at single-cell resolution in bacterial aggregates. Using quantitative image analysis of thousands of  cells, we validated new  HCR probes. Within  aggregates, we found that bacteria just below the aggregate surface are the primary cells expressing genes that protect the population against antibiotics and the immune system. This observation suggests that therapies targeting bacteria growing with small amounts of oxygen may be most effective against these hard-to-treat infections. More generally, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that HCR v3.0 has the potential to identify microbial activities  at small spatial scales in diverse contexts."

The  system is a noncanonical TA system in which the toxin and antitoxins genes are organized in operon but with the particularity that the toxin gene precedes that of the antitoxin. This system was shown to regulate global processes such as resistance to bile salts, motility, and biofilm formation. In addition, the MqsA antitoxin was shown to be a master regulator that represses the transcription of the , , and  global regulator genes, thereby displaying a pleiotropic regulatory role. Here, we identified two promoters located in the toxin sequence driving the constitutive expression of , allowing thereby excess production of the MqsA antitoxin compared to the MqsR toxin. Our results show that both antitoxin-specific and operon promoters are not regulated by stresses such as amino acid starvation, oxidative shock, or bile salts. Moreover, we show that the MqsA antitoxin is not a global regulator as suggested, since the expression of ,  and  is similar in wild-type and Δ mutant strains. Moreover, these two strains behave similarly in terms of biofilm formation and sensitivity to oxidative stress or bile salts.

The UPR is specifically activated after plant penetration and required for efficient secretion of effectors and suppression of the plant defense response. The interaction between the UPR regulator Cib1 and the central developmental regulator Clp1 modulates the pathogenic program and triggers fungal colonization of the host plant. By contrast, when activated before plant penetration, the UPR interferes with fungal virulence by reducing expression of  and , the central regulators of pathogenic development encoded by the  mating-type locus.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is crucial for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and disease development in fungal pathogens. In the plant-pathogenic fungus , the UPR supports fungal proliferation  and effector secretion for plant defense suppression. In this study, we uncovered that UPR activity, which is normally restricted to the biotrophic stage , inhibits mating and the formation of infectious filaments by Rok1-dependent dephosphorylation of the pheromone responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Kpp2. This observation is relevant for understanding how the fungal virulence program is regulated by cellular physiology. UPR-mediated control of mating-type signaling pathways predicts that effector gene expression and the virulence potential are controlled by ER stress levels."

Expression of the master competence regulator TfoX bypasses the need for chitin induction and drives expression of the genes required for competence in several  species. Here, we show that TfoX expression in  strains DS40M4 and NBRC 15631 enables high natural transformation frequencies. Conversely, transformation was not achieved in the model quorum-sensing strain  BB120 (previously classified as ). Surprisingly, we find that quorum sensing is not required for transformation in  DS40M4 or  in contrast to the established regulatory pathway in  in which quorum sensing is required to activate the competence regulator QstR. Similar to , expression of both QstR and TfoX is necessary for transformation in DS40M4. There is a wide disparity in transformation frequencies among even closely related  strains, with  having the lowest functional transformation frequency. Ectopic expression of both TfoX and QstR is sufficient to produce a significant increase in transformation frequency in  To explore differences in competence regulation, we used previously studied  competence genes to inform a comparative genomics analysis coupled with transcriptomics. We find that transformation capability cannot necessarily be predicted by the level of gene conservation but rather correlates with competence gene expression following TfoX induction. Thus, we have uncovered notable species- and strain-level variations in the competence gene regulation pathway across the  genus. Naturally transformable, or competent, bacteria are able to take up DNA from their environment, a key method of horizontal gene transfer for acquisition of new DNA sequences. Our research shows that  species that inhabit marine environments exhibit a wide diversity in natural transformation capability ranging from nontransformability to high transformation rates in which 10% of cells measurably incorporate new DNA. We show that the role of regulatory systems controlling the expression of competence genes (e.g., quorum sensing) differs throughout both the species and strain levels. We explore natural transformation capabilities of  species which have been thus far uncharacterized and find novel regulation of competence. Expression of two key transcription factors, TfoX and QstR, is necessary to stimulate high levels of transformation in  and recover low rates of transformation in ."

            "#text": "Influenza virus relies heavily on cellular machinery to replicate in host cells. Therefore, to better understand the influenza virus life cycle, it is important to identify which host proteins are involved and how they function in virus replication. Previously, we identified G protein pathway suppressor 1 (GPS1) to be a matrix protein 2 (M2)-interacting host protein. GPS1 is a component of the COP9 signalosome, which regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway. Here, we found that the downregulation of GPS1 expression reduced influenza virus replication by more than 2 log units. Although GPS1 was not involved in the early and late stages of virus replication, such as viral entry, uncoating, assembly, or budding, we found that viral polymerase activity was impaired in GPS1-downregulated cells. Moreover, our results suggest that M2 activates the NF-κB signaling pathway in a GPS1-dependent manner and that activation of NF-κB signaling leads to the upregulation of influenza virus polymerase activity. Our findings indicate that GPS1 is involved in the transcription and replication of influenza virus genomic RNA through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In the present study, we identified G protein pathway suppressor 1 (GPS1) to be a host cellular protein that is important for influenza virus replication. We also found that GPS1 plays a role in viral genome transcription through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, downregulation of GPS1 also affected the growth of vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, GPS1 may be a host target for antiviral drugs against influenza virus and possibly other viruses."

We conducted a validation and application study of unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to elucidate etiologies of meningitis in Bangladesh. This RNA mNGS study was performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from patients admitted in the largest pediatric hospital, a World Health Organization sentinel site, with known neurologic infections ( = 36), with idiopathic meningitis ( = 25), and with no infection ( = 30), and six environmental samples, collected between 2012 and 2018. We used the IDseq bioinformatics pipeline and machine learning to identify potentially pathogenic microbes, which we then confirmed orthogonally and followed up through phone/home visits. In samples with known etiology and without infections, there was 83% concordance between mNGS and conventional testing. In idiopathic cases, mNGS identified a potential bacterial or viral etiology in 40%. There were three instances of neuroinvasive Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), whose genomes were >99% identical to each other and to a Bangladeshi strain only previously recognized to cause febrile illness in 2017. CHIKV-specific qPCR of all remaining stored CSF samples from children who presented with idiopathic meningitis in 2017 ( = 472) revealed 17 additional CHIKV meningitis cases, exposing an unrecognized meningitis outbreak. Orthogonal molecular confirmation, case-based clinical data, and patient follow-up substantiated the findings. Case-control CSF mNGS surveys can complement conventional diagnostic methods to identify etiologies of meningitis, conduct surveillance, and predict outbreaks. The improved patient- and population-level data can inform evidence-based policy decisions. Globally, there are an estimated 10.6 million cases of meningitis and 288,000 deaths every year, with the vast majority occurring in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, many survivors suffer from long-term neurological sequelae. Most laboratories assay only for common bacterial etiologies using culture and directed PCR, and the majority of meningitis cases lack microbiological diagnoses, impeding institution of evidence-based treatment and prevention strategies. We report here the results of a validation and application study of using unbiased metagenomic sequencing to determine etiologies of idiopathic (of unknown cause) cases. This included CSF from patients with known neurologic infections, with idiopathic meningitis, and without infection admitted in the largest children's hospital of Bangladesh and environmental samples. Using mNGS and machine learning, we identified and confirmed an etiology (viral or bacterial) in 40% of idiopathic cases. We detected three instances of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) that were >99% identical to each other and to a strain previously recognized to cause systemic illness only in 2017. CHIKV qPCR of all remaining stored 472 CSF samples from children who presented with idiopathic meningitis in 2017 at the same hospital uncovered an unrecognized CHIKV meningitis outbreak. CSF mNGS can complement conventional diagnostic methods to identify etiologies of meningitis, and the improved patient- and population-level data can inform better policy decisions."

            "#text": "Mechanisms have evolved to prevent errors in replication, transcription, and translation of genetic material, with translational errors occurring most frequently. Errors in protein synthesis can occur at two steps, during tRNA aminoacylation and ribosome decoding. Recent advances in protein mass spectrometry have indicated that previous reports of translational errors have potentially underestimated the frequency of these events, but also that the majority of translational errors occur during ribosomal decoding, suggesting that aminoacylation errors are evolutionarily less tolerated. Despite that interpretation, there is evidence that some aminoacylation errors may be regulated, and thus provide a benefit to the cell, while others are clearly detrimental. Here, we show that while it has been suggested that regulated Thr-to-Ser substitutions may be beneficial, there is a threshold beyond which these errors are detrimental. In contrast, we show that errors mediated by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) are not well tolerated and induce a global stress response that leads to gross perturbation of the  proteome, with potentially catastrophic effects on fitness and viability. Tolerance for Ala mistranslation appears to be much lower than with other translational errors, consistent with previous reports of multiple proofreading mechanisms targeting mischarged tRNA These results demonstrate the essential role of aminoacyl-tRNA proofreading in optimizing cellular fitness and suggest that any potentially beneficial effects of mistranslation may be confined to specific amino acid substitutions. Errors in protein synthesis have historically been assumed to be detrimental to the cell. While there are many reports that translational errors are consequential, there is a growing body of evidence that some mistranslation events may be tolerated or even beneficial. Using two models of mistranslation, we compare the direct phenotypic effects of these events in  This work provides insight into the threshold for tolerance of specific mistranslation events that were previously predicted to be broadly neutral to proteome integrity. Furthermore, these data reveal the effects of mistranslation beyond the general unfolded stress response, leading to global translational reprogramming."

These practices led to genetic and phenotypic changes that are trackable through archaeological and genomic records. Bacteria, yeasts, and molds also experienced domestication during the agricultural revolution, but the effects of domestication on microbes are poorly understood in comparison to plants and animals. Bodinaku et al. used experimental evolution to track the phenotypic changes that occur when wild  molds specialize and adapt to the cheese environment (I. Bodinaku, J. Shaffer, A. B. Connors, J. L. Steenwyk, et al., mBio 10:e02445-19, 2019, https://mbio.asm.org/content/10/5/e02445-19.long). Amazingly, after only eight generations of growth in a laboratory cheese environment, mutants emerged whose traits resembled those of the Brie and Camembert cheese mold  This study demonstrated that the early stages of microbial domestication can occur rapidly and suggested that experimental evolution may be a viable strategy to exploit the metabolic diversity of wild microbes for food fermentation."

A carbapenem-resistant  strain classified as multilocus sequence type 258 (ST258) is widespread in the United States and is usually multidrug resistant. Thus, treatment of ST258 infections is often difficult. Inasmuch as new preventive and/or therapeutic measures are needed for treatment of such infections, we developed an ST258 pneumonia model in cynomolgus macaques and tested the ability of an ST258 capsule polysaccharide type 2 (CPS2) vaccine to moderate disease severity. Compared with sham-vaccinated animals, those vaccinated with ST258 CPS2 had significantly less disease as assessed by radiography 24 h after intrabronchial installation of 10 CFU of ST258. All macaques vaccinated with CPS2 ultimately developed ST258-specific antibodies that significantly enhanced serum bactericidal activity and killing of ST258 by macaque neutrophils  Consistent with a protective immune response to CPS2, transcripts encoding inflammatory mediators were increased in infected lung tissues obtained from CPS-vaccinated animals compared with control, sham-vaccinated macaques. Taken together, our data provide support for the idea that vaccination with ST258 CPS can be used to prevent or moderate infections caused by ST258. As with studies performed decades earlier, we propose that this prime-boost vaccination approach can be extended to include multiple capsule types.

To that end, we developed a lower respiratory tract infection model in cynomolgus macaques in which to test the ability of ST258 CPS to protect against severe ST258 infection."

Currently, little is known about specific factors that promote MRSA vaginal colonization and subsequent infection. To study  colonization of the female reproductive tract in a mammalian system, we developed a mouse model of  vaginal carriage and demonstrated that both hospital-associated and community-associated MRSA isolates can colonize the murine vaginal tract. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an increase in neutrophils in the vaginal lumen during MRSA colonization. Additionally, we observed that a mutant lacking fibrinogen binding adhesins exhibited decreased persistence within the mouse vagina. To further identify novel factors that promote vaginal colonization, we performed RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of MRSA growing  during vaginal carriage at 5 h, 1 day, and 3 days postinoculation. Over 25% of the bacterial genes were differentially regulated at all time points during colonization compared to laboratory cultures. The most highly induced genes were those involved in iron acquisition, including the Isd system and siderophore transport systems. Mutants deficient in these pathways did not persist as well during  colonization. These results reveal that fibrinogen binding and the capacity to overcome host nutritional limitation are important determinants of MRSA vaginal colonization. is an opportunistic pathogen able to cause a wide variety of infections in humans. Recent reports have suggested an increasing prevalence of MRSA in pregnant and postpartum women, coinciding with the increased incidence of MRSA infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and newborn nurseries. Vertical transmission from mothers to infants at delivery is a likely route of MRSA acquisition by the newborn; however, essentially nothing is known about host and bacterial factors that influence MRSA carriage in the vagina. Here, we established a mouse model of vaginal colonization and observed that multiple MRSA strains can persist in the vaginal tract. Additionally, we determined that MRSA interactions with fibrinogen and iron uptake can promote vaginal persistence. This study is the first to identify molecular mechanisms which govern vaginal colonization by MRSA, the critical initial step preceding infection and neonatal transmission."

Here, we argue that we can meet the evolution of resistance in the clinic with evolution of antibiotics in the laboratory. On the basis of the results of experimental evolution studies of microbes in general and antibiotic production in  in particular, we propose methodology for evolving antibiotics to circumvent mechanisms of resistance. This exploits the ability of evolution to find solutions to complex problems without a need for design. We review evolutionary theory critical to this approach and argue that it is feasible and has important advantages over current methods for antibiotic discovery."

            "#text": "A growing number of studies report that viruses can spread in groups in so-called collective infectious units. By increasing the cellular multiplicity of infection, collective dispersal may allow for social-like interactions, such as cooperation or cheating. Yet, little is known about how such interactions evolve. In previous work with vesicular stomatitis virus, we showed that virion aggregation accelerates early infection stages in most cell types, providing a short-term fitness benefit to the virus. Here, we examine the effects of virion aggregation over several infection cycles. Flow cytometry, deep sequencing, infectivity assays, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, and electron microscopy revealed that virion aggregation rapidly promotes the emergence of defective interfering particles. Therefore, virion aggregation provides immediate fitness benefits to the virus but incurs fitness costs after a few viral generations. This suggests that an optimal strategy for the virus is to undergo virion aggregation only episodically, for instance, during interhost transmission. Recent insights have revealed that viruses use a highly diverse set of strategies to release multiple viral genomes into the same target cells, allowing the emergence of beneficial, but also detrimental, interactions among viruses inside infected cells. This has prompted interest among microbial ecologists and evolutionary biologists in studying how collective dispersal impacts the outcome of viral infections. Here, we have used vesicular stomatitis virus as a model system to study the evolutionary implications of collective dissemination mediated by viral aggregates, since this virus can spontaneously aggregate in the presence of saliva. We find that saliva-driven aggregation has a dual effect on viral fitness; whereas aggregation tends to increase infectivity in the very short term, virion aggregates are highly susceptible to invasion by noncooperative defective variants after a few viral generations."

            "#text": "Experimental data showed that high-speed microsprays can effectively disrupt biofilms on their support substratum, producing a variety of dynamic reactions such as elongation, displacement, ripple formation, and fluidization. However, the mechanics underlying the impact of high-speed turbulent flows on biofilm structure is complex under such extreme conditions, since direct measurements of viscosity at these high shear rates are not possible using dynamic testing instruments. Here, we used computational fluid dynamics simulations to assess the complex fluid interactions of ripple patterning produced by high-speed turbulent air jets impacting perpendicular to the surface of  biofilms, a dental pathogen causing caries, captured by high-speed imaging. The numerical model involved a two-phase flow of air over a non-Newtonian biofilm, whose viscosity as a function of shear rate was estimated using the Herschel-Bulkley model. The simulation suggested that inertial, shear, and interfacial tension forces governed biofilm disruption by the air jet. Additionally, the high shear rates generated by the jet impacts coupled with shear-thinning biofilm property resulted in rapid liquefaction (within milliseconds) of the biofilm, followed by surface instability and traveling waves from the impact site. Our findings suggest that rapid shear thinning under very high shear flows causes the biofilm to behave like a fluid and elasticity can be neglected. A parametric sensitivity study confirmed that both applied force intensity (i.e., high jet nozzle air velocity) and biofilm properties (i.e., low viscosity and low air-biofilm surface tension and thickness) intensify biofilm disruption by generating large interfacial instabilities. Knowledge of mechanisms promoting disruption though mechanical forces is essential in optimizing biofilm control strategies which rely on fluid shear. Our results provide insight into how biofilm disruption dynamics is governed by applied forces and fluid properties, revealing a mechanism for ripple formation and fluid-biofilm mixing. These findings have important implications for the rational design of new biofilm cleaning strategies with fluid jets, such as determining optimal parameters (e.g., jet velocity and position) to remove the biofilm from a certain zone (e.g., in dental hygiene or debridement of surgical site infections) or using antimicrobial agents which could increase the interfacial area available for exchange, as well as causing internal mixing within the biofilm matrix, thus disrupting the localized microenvironment which is associated with antimicrobial tolerance. The developed model also has potential application in predicting drag and pressure drop caused by biofilms on bioreactor, pipeline, and ship hull surfaces."

            "#text": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a major role during control of mRNA localization, stability, and translation and are central to most cellular processes. In the fission yeast , the multiple K homology (KH) domain RBP Rnc1 downregulates the activity of the cell integrity pathway (CIP) via stabilization of  mRNA, which encodes the Pmp1 phosphatase that inactivates Pmk1, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) component of this signaling cascade. However, Rnc1 likely regulates the half-life/stability of additional mRNAs. We show that Rnc1 downregulates the activity of Sty1, the MAPK of the stress-activated MAPK pathway (SAPK), during control of cell length at division and recovery in response to acute stress. Importantly, this control strictly depends on Rnc1's ability to bind mRNAs encoding activators (Wak1 MAPKKK, Wis1 MAPKK) and downregulators (Atf1 transcription factor, Pyp1 and Pyp2 phosphatases) of Sty1 phosphorylation through its KH domains. Moreover, Sty1 is responsible for Rnc1 phosphorylation  at multiple phosphosites during growth and stress, and these modifications trigger Rnc1 for proper binding and destabilization of the above mRNA targets. Phosphorylation by Sty1 prompts Rnc1-dependent mRNA destabilization to negatively control SAPK signaling, thus revealing an additional feedback mechanism that allows precise tuning of MAPK activity during unperturbed cell growth and stress. Control of mRNA localization, stability, turnover, and translation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) influences essential processes in all eukaryotes, including signaling by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. We describe that in the fission yeast  the RBP Rnc1 negatively regulates cell length at division during unperturbed growth and recovery after acute stress by reducing the activity of the MAPK Sty1, which regulates cell growth and differentiation during environmental cues. This mechanism relies on Rnc1 binding to specific mRNAs encoding both enhancers and negative regulators of Sty1 activity. Remarkably, multiple phosphorylation of Rnc1 by Sty1 favors RBP binding and destabilization of the above mRNAs. Thus, posttranscriptional modulation of MAP kinase signaling by RNA-binding proteins emerges as a major regulatory mechanism that dictates the growth cycle and cellular adaptation in response to the changing environment in eukaryotic organisms."

            "#text": "Diet and host phylogeny drive the taxonomic and functional contents of the gut microbiome in mammals, yet it is unknown whether these patterns hold across all vertebrate lineages. Here, we assessed gut microbiomes from ∼900 vertebrate species, including 315 mammals and 491 birds, assessing contributions of diet, phylogeny, and physiology to structuring gut microbiomes. In most nonflying mammals, strong correlations exist between microbial community similarity, host diet, and host phylogenetic distance up to the host order level. In birds, by contrast, gut microbiomes are only very weakly correlated to diet or host phylogeny. Furthermore, while most microbes resident in mammalian guts are present in only a restricted taxonomic range of hosts, most microbes recovered from birds show little evidence of host specificity. Notably, among the mammals, bats host especially bird-like gut microbiomes, with little evidence for correlation to host diet or phylogeny. This suggests that host-gut microbiome phylosymbiosis depends on factors convergently absent in birds and bats, potentially associated with physiological adaptations to flight. Our findings expose major variations in the behavior of these important symbioses in endothermic vertebrates and may signal fundamental evolutionary shifts in the cost/benefit framework of the gut microbiome. In this comprehensive survey of microbiomes of >900 species, including 315 mammals and 491 birds, we find a striking convergence of the microbiomes of birds and animals that fly. In nonflying mammals, diet and short-term evolutionary relatedness drive the microbiome, and many microbial species are specific to a particular kind of mammal, but flying mammals and birds break this pattern with many microbes shared across different species, with little correlation either with diet or with relatedness of the hosts. This finding suggests that adaptation to flight breaks long-held relationships between hosts and their microbes."

            "#text": "It has been hypothesized that the abundant heterotrophic ocean bacterioplankton in the SAR202 clade of the phylum  evolved specialized metabolisms for the oxidation of organic compounds that are resistant to microbial degradation via common metabolic pathways. Expansions of paralogous enzymes were reported and implicated in hypothetical metabolism involving monooxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes. In the proposed metabolic schemes, the paralogs serve the purpose of diversifying the range of organic molecules that cells can utilize. To further explore SAR202 evolution and metabolism, we reconstructed single amplified genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes from locations around the world that included the deepest ocean trenches. In an analysis of 122 SAR202 genomes that included seven subclades spanning SAR202 diversity, we observed additional evidence of paralog expansions that correlated with evolutionary history, as well as further evidence of metabolic specialization. Consistent with previous reports, families of flavin-dependent monooxygenases were observed mainly in the group III SAR202 genomes, and expansions of dioxygenase enzymes were prevalent in those of group VII. We found that group I SAR202 genomes encode expansions of racemases in the enolase superfamily, which we propose evolved for the degradation of compounds that resist biological oxidation because of chiral complexity. Supporting the conclusion that the paralog expansions indicate metabolic specialization, fragment recruitment and fluorescent  hybridization (FISH) with phylogenetic probes showed that SAR202 subclades are indigenous to different ocean depths and geographical regions. Surprisingly, some of the subclades were abundant in surface waters and contained rhodopsin genes, altering our understanding of the ecological role of SAR202 species in stratified water columns. The oceans contain an estimated 662 Pg C in the form of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Information about microbial interactions with this vast resource is limited, despite broad recognition that DOM turnover has a major impact on the global carbon cycle. To explain patterns in the genomes of marine bacteria, we propose hypothetical metabolic pathways for the oxidation of organic molecules that are resistant to oxidation via common pathways. The hypothetical schemes we propose suggest new metabolic pathways and classes of compounds that could be important for understanding the distribution of organic carbon throughout the biosphere. These genome-based schemes will remain hypothetical until evidence from experimental cell biology can be gathered to test them. Our findings also fundamentally change our understanding of the ecology of SAR202 bacteria, showing that metabolically diverse variants of these cells occupy niches spanning all depths and are not relegated to the dark ocean."

However, the extent of the variability at the single-cell level and how it impacts virus-host interactions at a system level are not well understood. To characterize the dynamics of viral transcription and host responses, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify at multiple time points the host and viral transcriptomes of human A549 cells and primary bronchial epithelial cells infected with influenza A virus. We observed substantial variability in viral transcription between cells, including the accumulation of defective viral genomes (DVGs) that impact viral replication. We show (i) a correlation between DVGs and virus-induced variation of the host transcriptional program and (ii) an association between differential inductions of innate immune response genes and attenuated viral transcription in subpopulations of cells. These observations at the single-cell level improve our understanding of the complex virus-host interplay during influenza virus infection. Defective influenza virus particles generated during viral replication carry incomplete viral genomes and can interfere with the replication of competent viruses. These defective genomes are thought to modulate the disease severity and pathogenicity of an influenza virus infection. Different defective viral genomes also introduce another source of variation across a heterogeneous cell population. Evaluating the impact of defective virus genomes on host cell responses cannot be fully resolved at the population level, requiring single-cell transcriptional profiling. Here, we characterized virus and host transcriptomes in individual influenza virus-infected cells, including those of defective viruses that arise during influenza A virus infection. We established an association between defective virus transcription and host responses and validated interfering and immunostimulatory functions of identified dominant defective viral genome species  This study demonstrates the intricate effects of defective viral genomes on host transcriptional responses and highlights the importance of capturing host-virus interactions at the single-cell level."

            "#text": "CpG dinucleotide suppression has been reported to allow HIV-1 to evade inhibition by the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Here, we show that primate lentiviruses display marked differences in CpG frequencies across their genome, ranging from 0.44% in simian immunodeficiency virus SIVwrc from Western red colobus to 2.3% in SIVmon infecting mona monkeys. Moreover, functional analyses of a large panel of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses revealed that the magnitude of CpG suppression does not correlate with their susceptibility to ZAP. However, we found that the number of CpG dinucleotides within a region of ∼700 bases at the 5' end of the  gene determines ZAP sensitivity of primary HIV-1 strains but not of HIV-2. Increased numbers of CpGs in this region were associated with reduced  mRNA expression and viral protein production. ZAP sensitivity profiles of chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) expressing different HIV-1  genes were highly similar to those of the corresponding HIV-1 strains. The frequency of CpGs in the identified  region correlated with differences in clinical progression rates. Thus, the CpG frequency in a specific part of , rather than the overall genomic CpG content, governs the susceptibility of HIV-1 to ZAP and might affect viral pathogenicity  Evasion of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) may drive CpG dinucleotide suppression in HIV-1 and many other viral pathogens but the viral determinants of ZAP sensitivity are poorly defined. Here, we examined CpG suppression and ZAP sensitivity in a large number of primate lentiviruses and demonstrate that their genomic frequency of CpGs varies substantially and does not correlate with ZAP sensitivity. We further show that the number of CpG residues in a defined region at the 5' end of the  gene together with structural features plays a key role in HIV-1 susceptibility to ZAP and correlates with differences in clinical progression rates in HIV-1-infected individuals. Our identification of a specific part of  as a major determinant of HIV-1 susceptibility to ZAP restriction provides a basis for future studies of the underlying inhibitory mechanisms and their potential relevance in the pathogenesis of AIDS."

            "#text": "Panulirus argus virus 1 (PaV1) is the only known virus infecting the Caribbean spiny lobster () from the Caribbean Sea. Recently, related viruses, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes virus 1 (DhV1) and Carcinus maenas virus 1 (CmV1), have been detected in the demon shrimp () and the European shore crab (), respectively, from sites in the United Kingdom. The virion morphology of these crustacean viruses is similar to that of iridoviruses. However, unlike iridoviruses and other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), these viruses complete their morphogenesis in the host cell nucleus rather than in the cytoplasm. To date, these crustacean viruses have remained unclassified due to a lack of genomic data. Using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer, we sequenced the complete genomes of PaV1, CmV1, and DhV1. Comparative genome analysis shows that these crustacean virus genomes encode the 10 hallmark proteins previously described for the NCLDVs of eukaryotes, strongly suggesting that they are members of this group. With a size range of 70 to 74 kb, these are the smallest NCLDV genomes identified to date. Extensive gene loss, divergence of gene sequences, and the accumulation of low-complexity sequences reflect the extreme degradation of the genomes of these \"minimal\" NCLDVs rather than any direct relationship with the NCLDV ancestor. Phylogenomic analysis supports the classification of these crustacean viruses as a distinct family, \"Mininucleoviridae,\" within the pitho-irido-Marseille branch of the NCLDVs. Recent genomic and metagenomic studies have led to a dramatic expansion of the known diversity of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) of eukaryotes, which include giant viruses of protists and important pathogens of vertebrates, such as poxviruses. However, the characterization of viruses from nonmodel hosts still lags behind. We sequenced the complete genomes of three viruses infecting crustaceans, the Caribbean spiny lobster, demon shrimp, and European shore crab. These viruses have the smallest genomes among the known NCLDVs, with losses of many core genes, some of which are shared with iridoviruses. The deterioration of the transcription apparatus is compatible with microscopic and ultrastructural observations indicating that these viruses replicate in the nucleus of infected cells rather than in the cytoplasm. Phylogenomic analysis indicates that these viruses are sufficiently distinct from all other NCLDVs to justify the creation of a separate family, for which we propose the name \"Mininucleoviridae\" (i.e., small viruses reproducing in the cell nucleus)."

            "#text": "The intricate process of biofilm formation in the human pathogen  involves distinct stages during which a complex mixture of matrix molecules is produced and modified throughout the developmental cycle. Early in biofilm development, a subpopulation of cells detaches from its substrate in an event termed \"exodus\" that is mediated by SaePQRS-dependent stochastic expression of a secreted staphylococcal nuclease, which degrades extracellular DNA within the matrix, causing the release of cells and subsequently allowing for the formation of metabolically heterogenous microcolonies. Since the SaePQRS regulatory system is involved in the transcriptional control of multiple  virulence factors, the expression of several additional virulence genes was examined within a developing biofilm by introducing fluorescent gene reporter plasmids into wild-type  and isogenic regulatory mutants and growing these strains in a microfluidic system that supplies the bacteria with a constant flow of media while simultaneously imaging developing biofilms in 5-min intervals. This study demonstrated that multiple virulence genes, including , were expressed stochastically within a specialized subpopulation of cells in nascent biofilms. We demonstrated that virulence genes regulated by SaePQRS were stochastically expressed in nearly all strains examined whereas Agr-regulated genes were expressed more homogenously within maturing microcolonies. The commonly used Newman strain contains a variant of SaeS (SaeS) that confers constitutive kinase activity to the protein and caused this strain to lack the stochastic expression pattern observed in other strain backgrounds. Importantly, repair of the SaeS allele resulting in reversion to the well-conserved SaeS  allele found in other strains restored stochastic expression in this strain. is an important human pathogen capable of colonizing diverse tissue types and inducing severe disease in both immunocompromised and otherwise healthy individuals. Biofilm infections caused by this bacterial species are of particular concern because of their persistence, even in the face of intensive therapeutic intervention. The results of the current study demonstrate the stochastic nature of Sae-mediated virulence gene expression in  and indicate that this regulatory system may function as a \"bistable switch\" in a manner similar to that seen with regulators controlling competence gene expression in  and persister cell formation in  The results of this study provide a new perspective on the complex mechanisms utilized by  during the establishment of infections."

            "#text": "The strategy that microbial decomposers take with respect to using substrate for growth versus maintenance is one essential biological determinant of the propensity of carbon to remain in soil. To quantify the environmental sensitivity of this key physiological trade-off, we characterized the carbon use efficiency (CUE) of 23 soil bacterial isolates across seven phyla at three temperatures and with up to four substrates. Temperature altered CUE in both an isolate-specific manner and a substrate-specific manner. We searched for genes correlated with the temperature sensitivity of CUE on glucose and deemed those functional genes which were similarly correlated with CUE on other substrates to be validated as markers of CUE. Ultimately, we did not identify any such robust functional gene markers of CUE or its temperature sensitivity. However, we found a positive correlation between rRNA operon copy number and CUE, opposite what was expected. We also found that inefficient taxa increased their CUE with temperature, while those with high CUE showed a decrease in CUE with temperature. Together, our results indicate that CUE is a flexible parameter within bacterial taxa and that the temperature sensitivity of CUE is better explained by observed physiology than by genomic composition across diverse taxa. We conclude that the bacterial CUE response to temperature and substrate is more variable than previously thought. Soil microbes respond to environmental change by altering how they allocate carbon to growth versus respiration-or carbon use efficiency (CUE). Ecosystem and Earth System models, used to project how global soil C stocks will continue to respond to the climate crisis, often assume that microbes respond homogeneously to changes in the environment. In this study, we quantified how CUE varies with changes in temperature and substrate quality in soil bacteria and evaluated why CUE characteristics may differ between bacterial isolates and in response to altered growth conditions. We found that bacterial taxa capable of rapid growth were more efficient than those limited to slow growth and that taxa with high CUE were more likely to become less efficient at higher temperatures than those that were less efficient to begin with. Together, our results support the idea that the CUE temperature response is constrained by both growth rate and CUE and that this partly explains how bacteria acclimate to a warming world."

A bioinformatic prediction to identify possible interactions of Yfr1 with mRNAs was carried out by using the sequences of Yfr1 from several heterocyst-forming strains, including  sp. strain PCC 7120. The results of the prediction were enriched in genes encoding outer membrane proteins and enzymes related to peptidoglycan biosynthesis and turnover. Heterologous expression assays with  demonstrated direct interactions of Yfr1 with mRNAs of 11 of the candidate genes. The expression of 10 of them (, , , , , , , , , ) was repressed by interaction with Yfr1, whereas the expression of , encoding an amidase, was increased. The interactions between Yfr1 and the 11 mRNAs were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of Yfr1. Furthermore, a  strain with reduced levels of Yfr1 had larger amounts of  and  mRNAs, supporting a role for Yfr1 in the regulation of those genes.  strains with either reduced or increased expression of Yfr1 showed anomalies in cell wall completion and were more sensitive to vancomycin than the wild-type strain. Furthermore, growth in the absence of combined nitrogen, which involves the differentiation of heterocysts, was compromised in the strain overexpressing Yfr1, and filaments were broken at the connections between vegetative cells and heterocysts. These results indicate that Yfr1 is an important regulator of cell wall homeostasis and correct cell wall remodeling during heterocyst differentiation. Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are important players affecting the regulation of essentially every aspect of bacterial physiology. The cell wall is a highly dynamic structure that protects bacteria from their fluctuating environment. Cell envelope remodeling is particularly critical for bacteria that undergo differentiation processes, such as spore formation or differentiation of heterocysts. Heterocyst development involves the deposition of additional layers of glycolipids and polysaccharides outside the outer membrane. Here, we show that a cyanobacterial phylogenetically conserved small regulatory RNA, Yfr1, coordinates the expression of proteins involved in cell wall-related processes, including peptidoglycan metabolism and transport of different molecules, as well as expression of several proteins involved in heterocyst differentiation."

Here, we used phytoplankton, which are a classic model for evaluating interactions between species, grown with and without associated bacteria to test whether the bacteria alter the strength and type of species interactions within a trophic level. We demonstrate that host-associated bacteria alter host growth rates and carrying capacity. This did not change the type but frequently changed the strength of host interspecific interactions by facilitating host growth in the presence of an established species. These findings indicate that microbiomes can regulate their host species' interspecific interactions. As between-species interaction strength impacts their ability to coexist, our findings show that microbiomes have the potential to modulate eukaryotic species diversity and community composition. Description of the Earth's microbiota has recently undergone a phenomenal expansion that has challenged basic assumptions in many areas of biology, including hominid evolution, human gastrointestinal and neurodevelopmental disorders, and plant adaptation to climate change. By using the classic model system of freshwater phytoplankton that has been drawn upon for numerous foundational theories in ecology, we show that microbiomes, by facilitating their host population, can also influence between-species interactions among their eukaryotic hosts. Between-species interactions, including competition for resources, has been a central tenet in the field of ecology because of its implications for the diversity and composition of communities and how this in turn shapes ecosystem functioning."

            "#text": "Few studies have comprehensively investigated the temporal variability in soil microbial communities despite widespread recognition that the belowground environment is dynamic. In part, this stems from the challenges associated with the high degree of spatial heterogeneity in soil microbial communities and because the presence of relic DNA (DNA from dead cells or secreted extracellular DNA) may dampen temporal signals. Here, we disentangle the relationships among spatial, temporal, and relic DNA effects on prokaryotic and fungal communities in soils collected from contrasting hillslopes in Colorado, USA. We intensively sampled plots on each hillslope over 6 months to discriminate between temporal variability, intraplot spatial heterogeneity, and relic DNA effects on the soil prokaryotic and fungal communities. We show that the intraplot spatial variability in microbial community composition was strong and independent of relic DNA effects and that these spatial patterns persisted throughout the study. When controlling for intraplot spatial variability, we identified significant temporal variability in both plots over the 6-month study. These microbial communities were more dissimilar over time after relic DNA was removed, suggesting that relic DNA hinders the detection of important temporal dynamics in belowground microbial communities. We identified microbial taxa that exhibited shared temporal responses and show that these responses were often predictable from temporal changes in soil conditions. Our findings highlight approaches that can be used to better characterize temporal shifts in soil microbial communities, information that is critical for predicting the environmental preferences of individual soil microbial taxa and identifying linkages between soil microbial community composition and belowground processes. Nearly all microbial communities are dynamic in time. Understanding how temporal dynamics in microbial community structure affect soil biogeochemistry and fertility are key to being able to predict the responses of the soil microbiome to environmental perturbations. Here, we explain the effects of soil spatial structure and relic DNA on the determination of microbial community fluctuations over time. We found that intensive spatial sampling was required to identify temporal effects in microbial communities because of the high degree of spatial heterogeneity in soil and that DNA from nonliving sources masks important temporal patterns. We identified groups of microbes with shared temporal responses and show that these patterns were predictable from changes in soil characteristics. These results provide insight into the environmental preferences and temporal relationships between individual microbial taxa and highlight the importance of considering relic DNA when trying to detect temporal dynamics in belowground communities."

Converging evidence demonstrates that early normative development is affected by the gut microbiome, which itself can be altered by early psychosocial environments. However, much of our understanding of the gut microbiome's role in early development stems from nonhuman animal models and predominately focuses on the first years of life, during peri- and postnatal microbial colonization. As a first step to identify if these findings translate to humans and the extent to which these relationships are maintained after initial microbial colonization, we conducted a metagenomic investigation among a cross-sectional sample of early school-aged children with a range of adverse experiences and caregiver stressors and relationships. Our results indicate that the taxonomic and functional composition of the gut microbiome correlates with behavior during a critical period of child development. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that both socioeconomic risk exposure and child behaviors associate with the relative abundances of specific taxa (e.g.,  and  species) as well as functional modules encoded in their genomes (e.g., monoamine metabolism) that have been linked to cognition and health. While we cannot infer causality within this study, these findings suggest that caregivers may moderate the gut microbiome's link to environment and behaviors beyond the first few years of life. Childhood is a formative period of behavioral and biological development that can be modified, for better or worse, by the psychosocial environment that is in part determined by caregivers. Not only do our own genes and the external environment influence such developmental trajectories, but the community of microbes living in, on, and around our bodies-the microbiome-plays an important role as well. By surveying the gut microbiomes of a cross-sectional cohort of early school-aged children with a range of psychosocial environments and subclinical mental health symptoms, we demonstrated that caregiving behaviors modified the child gut microbiome's association to socioeconomic risk and behavioral dysregulation."

            "#text": "Increased intestinal permeability has been proposed as a mechanism of rotavirus-induced diarrhea. Studies with humans and mice have, however, shown that rotavirus leaves intestinal permeability unaffected or even reduced during diarrhea, in contrast to most bacterial infections. Gastrointestinal permeability is regulated by the vagus nerve and the enteric nervous system, which is composed of neurons and enteric glial cells (EGCs). We investigated whether the vagus nerve, serotonin (5-HT), EGCs, and neurotropic factors contribute to maintaining gut barrier homeostasis during rotavirus infection. Using subdiaphragmatic vagotomized and 5-HT receptor knockout mice, we found that the unaffected epithelial barrier during rotavirus infection is independent of the vagus nerve but dependent on 5-HT signaling through enteric intrinsic 5-HT receptors. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that rotavirus-infected enterocytes were in close contact with EGCs and enteric neurons and that the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was strongly upregulated in enterocytes of infected mice. Moreover, rotavirus and 5-HT activated EGCs (0.001). Using Ussing chambers, we found that GDNF and -nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) led to denser epithelial barriers in small intestinal resections from noninfected mice (0.01) and humans (0.001) and that permeability was unaffected in rotavirus-infected mice. GSNO made the epithelial barrier denser in Caco-2 cells by increasing the expression of the tight junction protein zona occludens 1 (0.001), resulting in reduced passage of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (0.05) in rotavirus-infected monolayers. This is the first report to show that neurotropic factors contribute to maintaining the gut epithelial barrier during viral insult. Human and mouse studies have shown that rotavirus infection is associated with low inflammation and unaffected intestinal barrier at the time of diarrhea, properties different from most bacterial and inflammatory diseases of the gut. We showed by , , and  experiments that neurotrophic factors and 5-HT have barrier protective properties during rotavirus insult. These observations advance our understanding of how the gut barrier is protected against rotavirus and suggest that rotavirus affects the gut barrier differently from bacteria. This is the first report to show that neurotrophic factors contribute to maintain the gut epithelial barrier during viral insult."

We used QUMA-1, an rG4-specific fluorescent probe, to detect rG4 structures in a wide range of bacterial species both  and in live cells and found rG4 to be an abundant RNA secondary structure across those species. Subsequently, to identify bacterial rG4 sites in the transcriptome, the model  strain and a major human pathogen, , were subjected to recently developed high-throughput rG4 structure sequencing (rG4-seq). In total, 168 and 161  rG4 sites were found in  and , respectively. Genes carrying these rG4 sites were found to be involved in virulence, gene regulation, cell envelope synthesis, and metabolism. More importantly, biophysical assays revealed the formation of a group of rG4 sites in mRNAs (such as  and ), and they were functionally validated in cells by genetic (point mutation and  reporter assays) and phenotypic experiments, providing substantial evidence for the formation and function of rG4s in bacteria. Overall, our study uncovers important regulatory functions of rG4s in bacterial pathogenicity and metabolic pathways and strongly suggests that rG4s exist and can be detected in a wide range of bacterial species.

This bacterial transfer process depends on the host actin cytoskeleton as the bacterium forms motile actin-rich membranous protrusions that propel the bacteria into neighboring cells, thus forming corresponding membrane invaginations.

Using isolated  protrusions added onto naive host cells, we demonstrate that actin-based propulsion is dispensable for caveolin-1 endocytosis as the presence of the protrusion/invagination interaction alone triggers caveolin-1 recruitment in the recipient cells. Finally, we provide a model of how this caveolin-1-based internalization event can exceed the theoretical size limit for this endocytic pathway."

Despite progress in the molecular understanding of the default silencing mechanism, the activation mechanism of the uniquely expressed  member remains elusive. A GC-rich noncoding RNA (ncRNA) gene family has coevolved with  species that express  genes. Here, we show that this ncRNA family is transcribed in a clonally variant manner, with predominant transcription of a single member occurring when the ncRNA is located adjacent to and upstream of an active  gene. We developed a specific CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) strategy that allowed for the transcriptional repression of all GC-rich members. A lack of GC-rich ncRNA transcription led to the downregulation of the entire  gene family in ring-stage parasites. Strikingly, in mature blood-stage parasites, the GC-rich ncRNA CRISPRi affected the transcription patterns of other clonally variant gene families, including the downregulation of all  members. We provide evidence for the key role of GC-rich ncRNA transcription in  gene activation and discovered a molecular link between the transcriptional control of various clonally variant multigene families involved in parasite virulence. This work opens new avenues for elucidating the molecular processes that control immune evasion and pathogenesis in  is the deadliest malaria parasite species, accounting for the vast majority of disease cases and deaths. The virulence of this parasite is reliant upon the mutually exclusive expression of cytoadherence proteins encoded by the 60-member  gene family. Antigenic variation of this multigene family serves as an immune evasion mechanism, ultimately leading to chronic infection and pathogenesis. Understanding the regulation mechanism of antigenic variation is key to developing new therapeutic and control strategies. Our study uncovers a novel layer in the epigenetic regulation of transcription of this family of virulence genes by means of a multigene-targeting CRISPR interference approach."

            "#text": "Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are encoded by many vertebrate species and exhibit antiviral activities against a wide range of viruses. IFITM3, when present in virus-producing cells, reduces the fusion potential of HIV-1 virions, but the mechanism is poorly understood. To define the breadth and mechanistic basis for the antiviral activity of IFITM3, we took advantage of a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based pseudotyping system. By carefully controlling amounts of IFITM3 and envelope protein (Env) in virus-producing cells, we found that IFITM3 potently inhibits MLV infectivity when Env levels are limiting. Loss of infectivity was associated with defective proteolytic processing of Env and lysosomal degradation of the Env precursor. Ecotropic and xenotropic variants of MLV Env, as well as HIV-1 Env and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), are sensitive to IFITM3, whereas Ebola glycoprotein is resistant, suggesting that IFITM3 selectively inactivates certain viral glycoproteins. Furthermore, endogenous IFITM3 in human and murine cells negatively regulates MLV Env abundance. However, we found that the negative impact of IFITM3 on virion infectivity is greater than its impact on decreasing Env incorporation, suggesting that IFITM3 may impair Env function, as well as reduce the amount of Env in virions. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of virion infectivity mediated by IFITM3 is reversed by the expression of glycoGag, a murine retrovirus accessory protein previously shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of SERINC proteins. Overall, we show that IFITM3 impairs virion infectivity by regulating Env quantity and function but that enhanced Env expression and glycoGag confer viral resistance to IFITM3. The viral envelope glycoprotein, known as \"Env\" in , is found on the virion surface and facilitates virus entry into cells by mediating cell attachment and fusion. Env is a major structural component of retroviruses and is targeted by all arms of the immune response, including adaptive and innate immunity. Less is known about how cell-intrinsic immunity prevents retrovirus replication at the level of individual cells. Here, we show that cellular IFITM3 and IFITM2 inhibit the fusion potential of retroviral virions by inhibiting Env protein via a two-pronged mechanism. IFITM proteins inhibit Env abundance in cells and also impair its function when levels are low. The posttranslational block of retroviral Env function by IFITM proteins is likely to impede both exogenous and endogenous retrovirus replication. In support of a relevant role for IFITM3 in retrovirus control, the retroviral accessory protein glycoGag counteracts IFITM3 function to promote virus infectivity."

            "#text": "In contrast to influenza virus vaccination, natural infection induces long-lived and relatively broad immune responses. However, many aspects of the antibody response to natural infection are not well understood. Here, we assessed the immune response after H1N1 influenza virus infection in children and adults in a Nicaraguan household transmission study using an influenza virus protein microarray (IVPM). This technology allows us to simultaneously measure IgG and IgA antibody responses to hemagglutinins of many different virus strains and subtypes quantitatively with a high throughput. We found that children under 6 years of age responded to natural infection with a relatively narrow response that targeted mostly the hemagglutinin of the strain that caused the infection. Adults, however, have a much broader response, including a boost in antibodies to many group 1 subtype hemagglutinins. Also, a strong recall response against historic H1 hemagglutinins that share the K133 epitope with the pandemic H1N1 virus was observed. Of note, some children, while responding narrowly within H1 and group 1 hemagglutinins, induced a boost to H3 and other group 2 hemagglutinins when infected with H1N1 when they had experienced an H3N2 infection earlier in life. This is an interesting phenomenon providing evidence for immune imprinting and a significant new insight which might be leveraged in future universal influenza virus vaccine strategies. Finally, preexisting immunity to pandemic H1 hemagglutinins was significantly associated with protection from infection in both children and adults. In adults, preexisting immunity to non-H1 group 1 hemagglutinins was also significantly associated with protection from infection. It is known since Thomas Francis, Jr. published his first paper on original antigenic sin in 1960 that the first infection(s) with influenza virus leaves a special immunological imprint which shapes immune responses to future infections with antigenically related influenza virus strains. Imprinting has been implicated in both protective effects as well as blunting of the immune response to vaccines. Despite the fact that this phenomenon was already described almost 60 years ago, we have very little detailed knowledge of the characteristics and breadth of the immune response to the first exposure(s) to influenza virus in life and how this compares to later exposure as adults. Here, we investigate these immune responses in detail using an influenza virus protein microarray. While our findings are mostly descriptive in nature and based on a small sample size, they provide a strong basis for future large-scale studies to better understand imprinting effects."

The strategic selection of phage combinations that impose high genetic barriers to resistance and/or high compensatory fitness costs may mitigate this threat. However, for such a strategy to be effective, the evolution of phage resistance must be sufficiently constrained to be consistent. In this study, we isolated lytic phages capable of infecting a modified  clinical isolate and characterized a total of 57 phage-resistant mutants that evolved from their prolonged coculture  Single- and double-phage-resistant mutants were isolated from independently evolved replicate cocultures grown in broth or on plates. Among resistant isolates evolved against the same phage under the same conditions, mutations conferring resistance occurred in different genes, yet in each case, the putative functions of these genes clustered around the synthesis or assembly of specific cell surface structures. All resistant mutants demonstrated impaired phage adsorption, providing a strong indication that these cell surface structures functioned as phage receptors. Combinations of phages targeting different host receptors reduced the incidence of resistance, while, conversely, one three-phage cocktail containing two phages targeting the same receptor increased the incidence of resistance (relative to its two-phage, nonredundant receptor-targeting counterpart). Together, these data suggest that laboratory characterization of phage-resistant mutants is a useful tool to help optimize therapeutic phage selection and cocktail design. The therapeutic use of bacteriophage (phage) is garnering renewed interest in the setting of difficult-to-treat infections. Phage resistance is one major limitation of phage therapy; therefore, developing effective strategies to avert or lessen its impact is critical. Characterization of  phage resistance may be an important first step in evaluating the relative likelihood with which phage-resistant populations emerge, the most likely phenotypes of resistant mutants, and the effect of certain phage cocktail combinations in increasing or decreasing the genetic barrier to resistance. If this information confers predictive power , then routine studies of phage-resistant mutants and their  evolution should be a valuable means for improving the safety and efficacy of phage therapy in humans."

The introduction of PfPARE mutations led to a similar level of resistance, and recombinant PfPARE hydrolyzed AN13762 to the benzoxaborole AN10248, which has activity similar to that of AN13762 but for which selection of resistance was not readily achieved. Parasites further selected with micromolar concentrations of AN13762 developed higher-level resistance (IC, 1.9 to 5.0 μM), and sequencing revealed additional mutations in any of 5 genes, 4 of which were associated with ubiquitination/sumoylation enzyme cascades; the introduction of one of these mutations, in SUMO-activating enzyme subunit 2, led to a similar level of resistance. The other gene mutated in highly resistant parasites encodes the  cleavage and specificity factor homolog PfCPSF3, previously identified as the antimalarial target of another benzoxaborole. Parasites selected for resistance to AN13762 were cross-resistant with a close analog, AN13956, but not with standard antimalarials, AN10248, or other benzoxaboroles known to have different  targets. Thus, AN13762 appears to have a novel mechanism of antimalarial action and multiple mechanisms of resistance, including loss of function of PfPARE preventing activation to AN10248, followed by alterations in ubiquitination/sumoylation pathways or PfCPSF3. Benzoxaboroles are under study as potential new drugs to treat malaria. One benzoxaborole, AN13762, has potent activity and promising features, but its mechanisms of action and resistance are unknown. To gain insights into these mechanisms, we cultured malaria parasites with nonlethal concentrations of AN13762 and generated parasites with varied levels of resistance. Parasites with low-level resistance had mutations in PfPARE, which processes AN13762 into an active metabolite; PfPARE mutations prevented this processing. Parasites with high-level resistance had mutations in any of a number of enzymes, mostly those involved in stress responses. Parasites selected for AN13762 resistance were not resistant to other antimalarials, suggesting novel mechanisms of action and resistance for AN13762, a valuable feature for a new class of antimalarial drugs."

Calcineurin is a conserved virulence factor in many pathogenic fungi, and calcineurin inhibition or deletion of the calcineurin regulatory subunit (CnbR) in  results in a shift from hyphal to yeast growth. We analyzed 36 calcineurin inhibitor-resistant or bypass mutants that exhibited hyphal growth in the presence of calcineurin inhibitors or in the yeast-locked Δ mutant background without carrying any mutations in known calcineurin components. We found that a majority of the mutants had altered sequence in a gene, named here  (pass of lcineurin).  encodes an amino acid permease. We verified that both the Δ single mutant and the Δ Δ double mutant are resistant to calcineurin inhibitor FK506, thereby demonstrating a novel mechanism of resistance against calcineurin inhibitors. We also found that the level of expression of  was significantly higher in the wild-type strain treated with FK506 and in the Δ mutants but was significantly lower in the wild-type strain without FK506 treatment. These findings suggest that  is a negative regulator of hyphal growth and/or a positive regulator of yeast growth in  and that calcineurin suppresses expression of the  gene at the mRNA level to promote hyphal growth. BycA is involved in the  hypha-yeast transition as our data demonstrate positive correlations among  expression, protein kinase A activity, and  yeast growth. Also, calcineurin, independently of its role in morphogenesis, contributes to virulence traits, including phagosome maturation blockade, host cell damages, and proangiogenic growth factor induction during interactions with hosts. is intrinsically resistant to most known antifungals, which makes mucormycosis treatment challenging. Calcineurin is a serine/threonine phosphatase that is widely conserved across eukaryotes. When calcineurin function is inhibited in , growth shifts to a less virulent yeast growth form, which makes calcineurin an attractive target for development of new antifungal drugs. Previously, we identified two distinct mechanisms through which  can become resistant to calcineurin inhibitors involving Mendelian mutations in the gene for FKBP12, including mechanisms corresponding to calcineurin A or B subunits and epimutations silencing the FKBP12 gene. Here, we identified a third novel mechanism where loss-of-function mutations in the amino acid permease corresponding to the  gene contribute to resistance against calcineurin inhibitors. When calcineurin activity is absent, BycA can activate protein kinase A (PKA) to promote yeast growth via a cAMP-independent pathway. Our data also show that calcineurin activity contributes to host-pathogen interactions primarily in the pathogenesis of"

Here, we explored the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in LTBI. The miRNA profiles were explored using the next-generation sequencing approach, followed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR validation. The biological function of candidate miRNA was evaluated using immunoblotting, immunofluorescence techniques, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in an  human TB granuloma model. An increased miR-889 expression was observed in patients with LTBI compared with that in patients without infection. The reporter assay identified tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) as the target of miR-889. Mycobacterial infection induced TWEAK upregulation in the early phase. TWEAK induced autophagy and promoted mycobacterial autophagosome maturation through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Upon entry to LTBI status, elevated miR-889 levels were associated with TNF alpha (TNF-α) and granuloma formation/maintenance. MiR-889 inhibited autophagy via posttranscriptional suppression of TWEAK expression to maintain mycobacterial survival in granulomas. Adalimumab (anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody) treatment reduced levels of both TNF-α and miR-889 and caused granuloma destruction and LTBI reactivation. The circulating miR-889 and TWEAK levels were correlated with LTBI and subsequently associated with anti-TNF-α-related LTBI reactivation in patients. We propose that miR-889 and TWEAK can act as targets that can be manipulated for antimycobacterial therapeutic purposes and act as candidate biomarkers for LTBI and LTBI reactivation, respectively. TB remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Approximately one-quarter of the world's population has latent TB infection. TWEAK is a multiple-function cytokine and may be used as a target for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and renal diseases. Here, we demonstrated a novel relationship between TWEAK and activation of the autophagic machinery which promotes antimycobacterial immunity. Additionally, TB infection is highly dynamic and determined by the interaction between the host and mycobacterium. We demonstrated a mechanism of fine-tuned balance between the mycobacterium and host for granuloma formation and/or maintenance in LTBI status. Once patients entered LTBI status, the upregulation of miR-889 was associated with TNF-α levels and granuloma formation to maintain mycobacterial survival. Adalimumab (a TNF-α inhibitor) reduced both TNF-α and miR-889 levels and caused LTBI reactivation and, thus, TWEAK enhancement. MiR-889 and TWEAK may become potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for LTBI and LTBI reactivation, respectively."

How bacteria optimize regulatory circuitries is crucial to understand bacterial adaptation. Here, we analyzed the experimental evolution of the plant pathogen  into legume symbionts after the transfer of a natural plasmid encoding the essential mutualistic genes. We showed that the Phc quorum sensing system required for the virulence of the ancestral bacterium was reconfigured to improve intracellular infection of root nodules induced by evolved  A single mutation in either the PhcB autoinducer synthase or the PhcQ regulator of the sensory cascade tuned the kinetics of activation of the central regulator PhcA in response to cell density so that the minimal stimulatory concentration of autoinducers needed for a given response was increased. Yet, a change in the expression of a PhcA target gene was observed in infection threads progressing in root hairs, suggesting early programming for the late accommodation of bacteria in nodule cells. Moreover, this delayed switch to the quorum sensing mode decreased the pathogenicity of the ancestral strain, illustrating the functional plasticity of regulatory systems and showing how a small modulation in signal response can produce drastic changes in bacterial lifestyle. Rhizobia are soil bacteria from unrelated genera able to form a mutualistic relationship with legumes. Bacteria induce the formation of root nodules, invade nodule cells, and fix nitrogen to the benefit of the plant. Rhizobial lineages emerged from the horizontal transfer of essential symbiotic genes followed by genome remodeling to activate and/or optimize the acquired symbiotic potential. This evolutionary scenario was replayed in a laboratory evolution experiment in which the plant pathogen  successively evolved the capacities to nodulate  and poorly invade, then massively invade, nodule cells. In some lines, the improvement of intracellular infection was achieved by mutations modulating a quorum sensing regulatory system of the ancestral strain. This modulation that affects the activity of a central regulator during the earliest stages of symbiosis has a huge impact on late stages of symbiosis. This work showed that regulatory rewiring is the main driver of this pathogeny-symbiosis transition."

            "#text": "Activation of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) plays a critical role in antiviral responses to many DNA viruses. Sensing of cytosolic DNA by cGAS results in synthesis of the endogenous second messenger cGAMP that activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in infected cells. Critically, cGAMP can also propagate antiviral responses to uninfected cells through intercellular transfer, although the modalities of this transfer between epithelial and immune cells remain poorly defined. We demonstrate here that cGAMP-producing epithelial cells can transactivate STING in cocultured macrophages through direct cGAMP transfer. cGAMP transfer was reliant upon connexin expression by epithelial cells and pharmacological inhibition of connexins blunted -dependent transactivation of the macrophage compartment. Macrophage transactivation by cGAMP contributed to a positive-feedback loop amplifying antiviral responses, significantly protecting uninfected epithelial cells against viral infection. Collectively, our findings constitute the first direct evidence of a connexin-dependent cGAMP transfer to macrophages by epithelial cells, to amplify antiviral responses. Recent studies suggest that extracellular cGAMP can be taken up by macrophages to engage STING through several mechanisms. Our work demonstrates that connexin-dependent communication between epithelial cells and macrophages plays a significant role in the amplification of antiviral responses mediated by cGAMP and suggests that pharmacological strategies aimed at modulating connexins may have therapeutic applications to control antiviral responses in humans."

Here, we describe the first  genomic island encoding a single Icm/Dot effector and a dedicated TCS, which regulates its expression. This genomic island, which we named Lci, undergoes horizontal gene transfer in the  genus, and the TCS encoded from this island (LciRS) is homologous to TCSs that control the expression of various metal resistance systems found in other bacteria. We found that the  sensor histidine kinase LciS is specifically activated by copper via a unique, small periplasmic sensing domain. Upon activation by LciS, the response regulator LciR directly binds to a conserved regulatory element and activates the expression of the adjacently located  effector-encoding gene. Thus, LciR represents the first local regulator of effectors identified in  Moreover, we found that the expression of the  operon is repressed by the Fis1 and Fis3 regulators, leading to Fis-mediated effects on copper induction of LciE and silencing of the expression of this genomic island in the absence of copper.

The adaptation of  to the intracellular environment requires coordination of expression of its multicomponent pathogenesis system, which is composed of a secretion system and effector proteins. However, the regulatory factors controlling the expression of this pathogenesis system are only partially uncovered. Here, we discovered a novel regulatory system that is activated by copper and controls the expression of a single effector protein. The genes encoding both the regulatory system and the effector protein are located on a genomic island that undergoes horizontal gene transfer within the  genus. This regulator-effector genomic island represents the first reported case of local regulation of effectors in  The discovery of this regulatory mechanism is an important step forward in the understanding of how the regulatory network of effectors functions and evolves in the  genus."

In this study, we systematically analyzed the  constraints underlying silencing and counter-silencing of the Lsr2-like protein CgpS in  Genome-wide analysis revealed binding of CgpS to regions featuring a distinct drop in GC profile close to the transcription start site (TSS) but also identified an overrepresented motif with multiple A/T steps at the nucleation site of the nucleoprotein complex. Binding of specific transcription factors (TFs) may oppose XS activity, leading to counter-silencing. Following a synthetic counter-silencing approach, target gene activation was realized by inserting operator sites of an effector-responsive TF within various CgpS target promoters, resulting in increased promoter activity upon TF binding. Analysis of reporter constructs revealed maximal counter-silencing when the TF operator site was inserted at the position of maximal CgpS coverage. This principle was implemented in a synthetic toggle switch, which features a robust and reversible response to effector availability, highlighting the potential for biotechnological applications. Together, our results provide comprehensive insights into how Lsr2 silencing and counter-silencing shape evolutionary network expansion in this medically and biotechnologically relevant bacterial phylum. In actinobacteria, Lsr2-like nucleoid-associated proteins function as xenogeneic silencers (XS) of horizontally acquired genomic regions, including viral elements, virulence gene clusters in , and genes involved in cryptic specialized metabolism in  species. Consequently, a detailed mechanistic understanding of Lsr2 binding  is relevant as a potential drug target and for the identification of novel bioactive compounds.

            "#text": "Plant roots influence the soil microbiota via physical interaction, secretion, and plant immunity. However, it is unclear whether the root fraction or soil is more important in determining the structure of the prokaryotic or eukaryotic community and whether this varies between plant species. Furthermore, the leaf (phyllosphere) and root microbiotas have a large overlap; however, it is unclear whether this results from colonization of the phyllosphere by the root microbiota. Soil, rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and root endosphere prokaryote-, eukaryote-, and fungus-specific microbiotas of four plant species were analyzed with high-throughput sequencing. The strengths of factors controlling microbiota structure were determined using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) statistics. The origin of the phyllosphere microbiota was investigated using a soil swap experiment. Global microbial kingdom analysis conducted simultaneously on multiple plants shows that cereals, legumes, and Brassicaceae establish similar prokaryotic and similar eukaryotic communities inside and on the root surface. While the bacterial microbiota is recruited from the surrounding soil, its profile is influenced by the root itself more so than by soil or plant species. However, in contrast, the fungal microbiota is most strongly influenced by soil. This was observed in two different soils and for all plant species examined. Microbiota structure is established within 2 weeks of plant growth in soil and remains stable thereafter. A reciprocal soil swap experiment shows that the phyllosphere is colonized from the soil in which the plant is grown. Global microbial kingdom analysis conducted simultaneously on multiple plants shows that cereals, legumes, and Brassicaceae establish similar prokaryotic and similar eukaryotic communities inside and on the root surface. While the bacterial microbiota is recruited from the surrounding soil, its profile is influenced by the root fraction more so than by soil or plant species. However, in contrast, the fungal microbiota is most strongly influenced by soil. This was observed in two different soils and for all plant species examined, indicating conserved adaptation of microbial communities to plants. Microbiota structure is established within 2 weeks of plant growth in soil and remains stable thereafter. We observed a remarkable similarity in the structure of a plant's phyllosphere and root microbiotas and show by reciprocal soil swap experiments that both fractions are colonized from the soil in which the plant is grown. Thus, the phyllosphere is continuously colonized by the soil microbiota."

            "#text": "Gut microbiota-derived endotoxin has been linked to human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the specific causative agents and their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we investigated whether bacterial strains of endotoxin-producing pathogenic species overgrowing in obese human gut can work as causative agents for NAFLD. We further assessed the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) cross talk in this pathogenicity. Nonvirulent strains of Gram-negative pathobionts were isolated from obese human gut and monoassociated with C57BL/6J germfree (GF) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Deletion of  in the bacterial endotoxin synthetic pathway and knockout of TLR4 in GF mice were used to further study the underlying mechanism for a causal relationship between these strains and the development of NAFLD. Three endotoxin-producing strains,  B29,  PY102, and  A7, overgrowing in the gut of morbidly obese volunteers with severe fatty liver, induced NAFLD when monoassociated with GF mice on HFD, while HFD alone did not induce the disease in GF mice. The commensal  (ATCC 29148), whose endotoxin activity was markedly lower than that of  strains, did not induce NAFLD in GF mice. B29 lost its proinflammatory properties and NAFLD-inducing capacity upon deletion of the  gene. Moreover,  B29 did not induce NAFLD in TLR4-deficient GF mice. These nonvirulent endotoxin-producing strains in pathobiont species overgrowing in human gut may work as causative agents, with LPS-TLR4 cross talk as the most upstream and essential molecular event for NAFLD. Recent studies have reported a link between gut microbiota and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), showing that germfree (GF) mice do not develop metabolic syndromes, including NAFLD. However, the specific bacterial species causing NAFLD, as well as their molecular cross talk with the host for driving liver disease, remain elusive. Here, we found that nonvirulent endotoxin-producing strains of pathogenic species overgrowing in obese human gut can act as causative agents for induction of NAFLD and related metabolic disorders. The cross talk between endotoxin from these specific producers and the host's TLR4 receptor is the most upstream and essential molecular event for inducing all phenotypes in NAFLD and related metabolic disorders. These nonvirulent endotoxin-producing strains of gut pathogenic species overgrowing in human gut may collectively become a predictive biomarker or serve as a novel therapeutic target for NAFLD and related metabolic disorders."

            "#text": "Symbiotic bacteria use diverse strategies to compete for host colonization sites. However, little is known about the environmental cues that modulate interbacterial competition as they transition between free-living and host-associated lifestyles. We used the mutualistic relationship between  squid and  bacteria to investigate how intraspecific competition is regulated as symbionts move from the seawater to a host-like environment. We recently reported that  uses a type VI secretion system (T6SS) for intraspecific competition during host colonization. Here, we investigated how environmental viscosity impacts T6SS-mediated competition by using a liquid hydrogel medium that mimics the viscous host environment. Our data demonstrate that although the T6SS is functionally inactive when cells are grown under low-viscosity liquid conditions similar to those found in seawater, exposure to a host-like high-viscosity hydrogel enhances T6SS expression and sheath formation, activates T6SS-mediated killing in as little as 30 min, and promotes the coaggregation of competing genotypes. Finally, the use of mass spectrometry-based proteomics revealed insights into how cells may prepare for T6SS competition during this habitat transition. These findings, which establish the use of a new hydrogel culture condition for studying T6SS interactions, indicate that  rapidly responds to the physical environment to activate the competitive mechanisms used during host colonization. Bacteria often engage in interference competition to gain access to an ecological niche, such as a host. However, little is known about how the physical environment experienced by free-living or host-associated bacteria influences such competition. We used the bioluminescent squid symbiont  to study how environmental viscosity impacts bacterial competition. Our results suggest that upon transition from a planktonic environment to a host-like environment,  cells activate their type VI secretion system, a contact-dependent interbacterial nanoweapon, to eliminate natural competitors. This work shows that competitor cells form aggregates under host-like conditions, thereby facilitating the contact required for killing, and reveals how  regulates a key competitive mechanism in response to the physical environment."

We previously showed that infection with the human bacterial pathogen  elicits transient mitochondrial fission and a drop in mitochondrion-dependent energy production through a mechanism requiring the bacterial pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). Here, we performed quantitative mitochondrial proteomics to search for host factors involved in -induced mitochondrial fission. We found that Mic10, a critical component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, is significantly enriched in mitochondria isolated from cells infected with wild-type but not with LLO-deficient  Increased mitochondrial Mic10 levels did not correlate with upregulated transcription, suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism. We then showed that Mic10 is necessary for -induced mitochondrial network fragmentation and that it contributes to  cellular infection independently of MICOS proteins Mic13, Mic26, and Mic27. In conclusion, investigation of  infection allowed us to uncover a role for Mic10 in mitochondrial fission. Pathogenic bacteria can target host cell organelles to take control of key cellular processes and promote their intracellular survival, growth, and persistence. Mitochondria are essential, highly dynamic organelles with pivotal roles in a wide variety of cell functions. Mitochondrial dynamics and function are intimately linked. Our previous research showed that  infection impairs mitochondrial function and triggers fission of the mitochondrial network at an early infection stage, in a process that is independent of the presence of the main mitochondrial fission protein Drp1. Here, we analyzed how mitochondrial proteins change in response to  infection and found that infection raises the levels of Mic10, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein involved in formation of cristae. We show that Mic10 is important for -dependent mitochondrial fission and infection of host cells. Our findings thus offer new insight into the mechanisms used by  to hijack mitochondria to optimize host infection."

            "#text": "The apicomplexan parasites  spp. are the causative agents of malaria, a disease that poses a significant global health burden.  spp. initiate infection of the human host by transforming and replicating within hepatocytes. This liver stage (LS) is poorly understood compared to other  life stages, which has hindered our ability to target these parasites for disease prevention. We conducted an extensive transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis throughout the  LS, covering as early as 2 h postinfection (hpi) and extending to 48 hpi. Our data revealed that hundreds of genes are differentially expressed at 2 hpi and that multiple genes shown to be important for later infection are upregulated as early as 12 hpi. Using hierarchical clustering along with coexpression analysis, we identified clusters functionally enriched for important liver-stage processes such as interactions with the host cell and redox homeostasis. Furthermore, some of these clusters were highly correlated to the expression of ApiAP2 transcription factors, while showing enrichment of mostly uncharacterized DNA binding motifs. This finding indicates potential LS targets for these transcription factors, while also hinting at alternative uncharacterized DNA binding motifs and transcription factors during this stage. Our work presents a window into the previously undescribed transcriptome of  upon host hepatocyte infection to enable a comprehensive view of the parasite's LS. These findings also provide a blueprint for future studies that extend hypotheses concerning LS gene function in  to human-infective  parasites. The LS of  infection is an asymptomatic yet necessary stage for producing blood-infective parasites, the causative agents of malaria. Blocking the liver stage of the life cycle can prevent clinical malaria, but relatively less is known about the parasite's biology at this stage. Using the rodent model , we investigated whole-transcriptome changes occurring as early as 2 hpi of hepatocytes. The transcriptional profiles of early time points (2, 4, 12, and 18 hpi) have not been accessible before due to the technical challenges associated with liver-stage infections. Our data now provide insights into these early parasite fluxes that may facilitate establishment of infection, transformation, and replication in the liver."

They correlate with each other and with a lean body type. Whether species of these two families interact and how they affect the body type are unanswered questions. Here, we show that species within these families correlate with each other across people. We also demonstrate that particular species of these two families grow together in dense flocs, wherein the bacteria provide hydrogen gas to the archaea, which then make methane. When the archaea are present, the ratio of bacterial products (which are nutrients for humans) is changed. These observations indicate that when these species grow together, their products have the potential to affect the physiology of their human host."

We studied the interaction of  with human CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM6 receptors (hCEACAMs) expressed on myeloid cells from CEACAM-humanized mice. Human and CEACAM-humanized mouse polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) allowed a specific HopQ-dependent interaction strongly enhancing CagA translocation. Translocated CagA was tyrosine phosphorylated, which was not seen in wild-type (wt) murine neutrophils. In contrast, human or murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) revealed a low hCEACAM expression and bacterial binding. CagA translocation and tyrosine-phosphorylation was low and independent of the HopQ-CEACAM interaction. Neutrophils, but not macrophages or DCs, from CEACAM-humanized mice, significantly upregulated the proinflammatory chemokine MIP-1α. However, macrophages showed a significantly reduced amount of CXCL1 (KC) and CCL2 (MCP-1) secretion in CEACAM-humanized versus wt cells. Thus, , via the HopQ-CEACAM interaction, controls the production and secretion of chemokines differently in PMNs, macrophages, and DCs.

Here, we show that human or CEACAM-humanized, but not mouse neutrophils are manipulated by the  HopQ-CEACAM interaction. Human CEACAMs are responsible for CagA phosphorylation, activation, and processing in neutrophils, whereas CagA translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation in DCs and macrophages is independent of the HopQ-CEACAM interaction.  affects the secretion of distinct chemokines in CEACAM-humanized neutrophils and macrophages. Most importantly, human CEACAMs on neutrophils enhance binding, oxidative burst, and phagocytosis of  and enhance bacterial survival in the phagosome. The -CEACAM interaction modulates PMNs to reduce the  CagA translocation efficiency  and to fine-tune the expression of CEACAM receptors on neutrophils to limit translocation of CagA and gastric pathology."

            "#text": "Venezuelan and western equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV and WEEV, respectively) invade the central nervous system (CNS) early during infection, via neuronal and hematogenous routes. While viral replication mediates host shutoff, including expression of type I interferons (IFN), few studies have addressed how alphaviruses gain access to the CNS during established infection or the mechanisms of viral crossing at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we show that hematogenous dissemination of VEEV and WEEV into the CNS occurs via caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-mediated transcytosis (Cav-MT) across an intact BBB, which is impeded by IFN and inhibitors of RhoA GTPase. Use of reporter and nonreplicative strains also demonstrates that IFN signaling mediates viral restriction within cells comprising the neurovascular unit (NVU), differentially rendering brain endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes permissive to viral replication. Transmission and immunoelectron microscopy revealed early events in virus internalization and Cav-1 association within brain endothelial cells. Cav-1-deficient mice exhibit diminished CNS VEEV and WEEV titers during early infection, whereas viral burdens in peripheral tissues remained unchanged. Our findings show that alphaviruses exploit Cav-MT to enter the CNS and that IFN differentially restricts this process at the BBB. VEEV, WEEV, and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) are emerging infectious diseases in the Americas, and they have caused several major outbreaks in the human and horse population during the past few decades. Shortly after infection, these viruses can infect the CNS, resulting in severe long-term neurological deficits or death. Neuroinvasion has been associated with virus entry into the CNS directly from the bloodstream; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that following peripheral infection alphavirus augments vesicular formation/trafficking at the BBB and utilizes Cav-MT to cross an intact BBB, a process regulated by activators of Rho GTPases within brain endothelium.  examination of early viral entry in Cav-1-deficient mice revealed significantly lower viral burdens in the brain than in similarly infected wild-type animals. These studies identify a potentially targetable pathway to limit neuroinvasion by alphaviruses."

            "#text": "Human skin microbiota has been described as a \"microbial fingerprint\" due to observed differences between individuals. Current understanding of the cutaneous microbiota is based on sampling the outermost layers of the epidermis, while the microbiota in the remaining skin layers has not yet been fully characterized. Environmental conditions can vary drastically between the cutaneous compartments and give rise to unique communities. We demonstrate that the dermal microbiota is surprisingly similar among individuals and contains a specific subset of the epidermal microbiota. Variability in bacterial community composition decreased significantly from the epidermal to the dermal compartment but was similar among anatomic locations (hip and knee). The composition of the epidermal microbiota was more strongly affected by environmental factors than that of the dermal community. These results indicate a well-conserved dermal community that is functionally distinct from the epidermal community, challenging the current dogma. Future studies in cutaneous disorders and chronic infections may benefit by focusing on the dermal microbiota as a persistent microbial community. Human skin microbiota is thought to be unique according to the individual's lifestyle and genetic predisposition. This is true for the epidermal microbiota, while our findings demonstrate that the dermal microbiota is universal between healthy individuals. The preserved dermal microbial community is compositionally unique and functionally distinct to the specific environment in the depth of human skin. It is expected to have direct contact with the immune response of the human host, and research in the communication between host and microbiota should be targeted to this cutaneous compartment. This novel insight into specific microbial adaptation can be used advantageously in the research of chronic disorders and infections of the skin. It can enlighten the alteration between health and disease to the benefit of patients suffering from long-lasting socioeconomic illnesses."

It is very urgent but also challenging to develop antipersister strategies. Here, we report that 10-s freezing with liquid nitrogen dramatically enhances the bactericidal action of aminoglycoside antibiotics by 2 to 6 orders of magnitude against many Gram-negative pathogens, with weaker potentiation effects on Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, antibiotic-tolerant  and  persisters-which were prepared by treating exponential-phase cells with ampicillin, ofloxacin, the protonophore cyanide -chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), or bacteriostatic antibiotics-can be effectively killed. We demonstrated, as a proof of concept, that freezing potentiated the aminoglycosides' killing of  persisters in a mouse acute skin wound model. Mechanistically, freezing dramatically increased the bacterial uptake of aminoglycosides regardless of the presence of CCCP, indicating that the effects are independent of the proton motive force (PMF). In line with these results, we found that the effects were linked to freezing-induced cell membrane damage and were attributable, at least partly, to the mechanosensitive ion channel MscL, which was able to directly mediate such freezing-enhanced aminoglycoside uptake. In view of these results, we propose that the freezing-induced aminoglycoside potentiation is achieved by freezing-induced cell membrane destabilization, which, in turn, activates the MscL channel, which is able to effectively take up aminoglycosides in a PMF-independent manner. Our work may pave the way for the development of antipersister strategies that utilize the same mechanism as freezing but do so without causing any injury to animal cells. Antibiotics have long been used to successfully kill bacterial pathogens, but antibiotic resistance/tolerance usually has led to the failure of antibiotic therapy, and it has become a severe threat to human health. How to improve the efficacy of existing antibiotics is of importance for combating antibiotic-resistant/tolerant pathogens. Here, we report that 10-s rapid freezing with liquid nitrogen dramatically enhanced the bactericidal action of aminoglycoside antibiotics by 2 to 6 orders of magnitude against many bacterial pathogens  and also in a mouse skin wound model. In particular, such combined treatment was able to effectively kill persister cells of  and , which are  tolerant of conventional treatment with bactericidal antibiotics for several hours. We also demonstrated that freezing-induced aminoglycoside potentiation was apparently linked to freezing-induced cell membrane damage that may have activated the mechanosensitive ion channel MscL, which, in turn, was able to effectively uptake aminoglycoside antibiotics in a proton motive force-independent manner. Our report sheds light on the development of a new strategy against bacterial pathogens by combining existing antibiotics with a conventional physical treatment or with MscL agonists."

Many antibiotic resistance traits, in particular, vancomycin resistance, can be encoded in autonomous and extrachromosomal elements called plasmids. These sequences can be disseminated to other isolates by horizontal gene transfer and confer novel mechanisms to source specificity. In our study, we elucidated the total plasmid content, referred to as the plasmidome, of 1,644  isolates by using short- and long-read whole-genome technologies with the combination of a machine-learning classifier. This was fundamental to investigate the full collection of plasmid sequences present in our collection (pan-plasmidome) and to observe the potential transfer of plasmid sequences between  hosts. We observed that  isolates from hospitalized patients carried a larger number of plasmid sequences compared to that from other sources, and they elucidated different configurations of plasmidome populations in the hospital environment. We assessed the contribution of different genomic components and observed that plasmid sequences have the highest contribution to source specificity. Our study suggests that  plasmids are regulated by complex ecological constraints rather than physical interaction between hosts."

In order to delineate the factors responsible for this serotype transition, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of  O1 multidrug-resistant strains belonging to both the serotypes that were isolated during this interval where the emergence and subsequent reduction of the Inaba serotype occurred. The whole-genome-based phylogenetic analysis revealed clonal expansion of the Inaba isolates mainly responsible for the peaks of infection during 2016 to 2017 and that they might have evolved from the prevailing Ogawa strains in 2015 which coclustered with them. Furthermore, the  gene in these Inaba serotype isolates was inactivated due to insertion of a transposable element at the same position signifying the clonal expansion. Also,  isolates in the Inaba serotype dominant clade mainly contained classical  allele and revealed differences in the genetic composition of eventh andemic sland II (VSP-II) and the SXT integrative and conjugative element (SXT-ICE) compared to those of Ogawa serotype strains which remerged in 2018. The variable presence of phage-inducible chromosomal island-like element 1 (PLE1) was also noted in the isolates of the Inaba serotype dominant clade. The detailed genomic characterization of the sequenced isolates has shed light on the forces which could be responsible for the periodic changes in serotypes of  and has also highlighted the need to analyze the mobilome in greater detail to obtain insights into the mechanisms behind serotype switching. The switching of serotype from Ogawa to Inaba and back to Ogawa has been observed temporally in  O1, which is responsible for endemic cholera in Bangladesh. The serospecificity is key for effective intervention and for preventing cholera, a deadly disease that continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the present study, WGS of  allowed us to better understand the factors associated with the serotype switching events observed during 2015 to 2018. Genomic data analysis of strains isolated during this interval highlighted variations in the genes , , and  and also identified significant differences in the genetic content of the mobilome, which included key elements such as SXT ICE, VSP-II, and PLE. Our results indicate that selective forces such as antibiotic resistance and phage resistance might contribute to the clonal expansion and predominance of a particular  serotype responsible for an outbreak."

However, the outcomes from most dietary fibers currently used as prebiotics are a result of competition between microbes with overlapping abilities to utilize these fibers. Thus, divergent fiber responses are observed across individuals harboring distinct microbial communities. Here, we propose that dietary fibers can be classified hierarchically according to their specificity toward gut microbes. Highly specific fibers harbor chemical and physical characteristics that allow them to be utilized by only a narrow group of bacteria within the gut, reducing competition for that substrate. The use of such fibers as prebiotics targeted to specific microbes would result in predictable shifts independent of the background microbial composition.",

            "#text": "Colorectal adenomas are precancerous lesions of colorectal cancer (CRC) that offer a means of viewing the events key to early CRC development. A number of studies have investigated the changes and roles of gut microbiota in adenoma and carcinoma development, highlighting its impact on carcinogenesis. However, there has been less of a focus on the gut metabolome, which mediates interactions between the host and gut microbes. Here, we investigated metabolomic profiles of stool samples from patients with advanced adenoma (= 102), matched controls (= 102), and patients with CRC (= 36). We found that several classes of bioactive lipids, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and sphingolipids, were elevated in the adenoma patients compared to the controls. Most such metabolites showed directionally consistent changes in the CRC patients, suggesting that those changes may represent early events of carcinogenesis. We also examined gut microbiome-metabolome associations using gut microbiota profiles in these patients. We found remarkably strong overall associations between the microbiome and metabolome data and catalogued a list of robustly correlated pairs of bacterial taxa and metabolomic features which included signatures of adenoma. Our findings highlight the importance of gut metabolites, and potentially their interplay with gut microbes, in the early events of CRC pathogenesis. Colorectal adenomas are precursors of CRC. Recently, the gut microbiota, i.e., the collection of microbes residing in our gut, has been recognized as a key player in CRC development. There have been a number of gut microbiota profiling studies for colorectal adenoma and CRC; however, fewer studies have considered the gut metabolome, which serves as the chemical interface between the host and gut microbiota. Here, we conducted a gut metabolome profiling study of colorectal adenoma and CRC and analyzed the metabolomic profiles together with paired microbiota composition profiles. We found several chemical signatures of colorectal adenoma that were associated with some gut microbes and potentially indicative of future CRC. This study highlights potential early-driver metabolites in CRC pathogenesis and guides further targeted experiments and thus provides an important stepping stone toward developing better CRC prevention strategies."

The associated heterotrophic bacterial assembly mostly constituted five classes, including , , , , and  The seven most abundant taxa/genera comprised >90% of the total heterotrophic bacterial community, and five of these displayed distinct lifestyle preferences (free-living or attached) and responses to  growth phases. Six high-quality genomes, including  and the five dominant heterotrophic bacteria, were reconstructed. The only primary producer of the coculture system, , displayed metabolic processes primarily involved in inorganic nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and organic matter biosynthesis and release. Two of the flavobacterial populations,  and , and an SM1A02 population, displayed preferences for initial degradation of complex compounds and biopolymers, as evinced by high abundances of TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs), glycoside hydrolase, and peptidase proteins. Polysaccharide utilization loci present in the flavobacterial genomes influence their lifestyle preferences and close associations with phytoplankton. In contrast, the alphaproteobacterium  sp. population mainly utilized low-molecular-weight dissolved organic carbon (DOC) through ATP-binding cassette (ABC), tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP), and tripartite tricarboxylate transporter (TTT) transport systems. The heterotrophic bacterial populations exhibited complementary mechanisms for degrading derived organic matter and driving nutrient cycling. In addition to nutrient exchange, removal of reactive oxygen species and vitamin trafficking might also contribute to the maintenance of the -heterotroph coculture system and the interactions shaping the system. The high complexity of  ecosystems renders it difficult to study marine microbial photoautotroph-heterotroph interactions. Two-member coculture systems of picocyanobacteria and single heterotrophic bacterial strains have been thoroughly investigated. However,  interactions comprise far more diverse heterotrophic bacterial associations with single photoautotrophic organisms. In the present study, combined metagenomic and metaproteomic data supplied the metabolic potentials and activities of uncultured dominant bacterial populations in the coculture system. The results of this study shed light on the nature of interactions between photoautotrophs and heterotrophs, improving our understanding of the complexity of  environments."

            "#text": "A fundamental goal of contemporary biomedical research is to understand the molecular basis of disease pathogenesis and exploit this information to develop targeted and more-effective therapies. Necrotizing myositis caused by the bacterial pathogen  is a devastating human infection with a high mortality rate and few successful therapeutic options. We used dual transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomes of  and host skeletal muscle recovered contemporaneously from infected nonhuman primates. The  bacterial transcriptome was strikingly remodeled compared to organisms grown , with significant upregulation of genes contributing to virulence and altered regulation of metabolic genes. The transcriptome of muscle tissue from infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) differed significantly from that of mock-infected animals, due in part to substantial changes in genes contributing to inflammation and host defense processes. We discovered significant positive correlations between group A streptococcus (GAS) virulence factor transcripts and genes involved in the host immune response and inflammation. We also discovered significant correlations between the magnitude of bacterial virulence gene expression  and pathogen fitness, as assessed by previously conducted genome-wide transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS). By integrating the bacterial RNA-seq data with the fitness data generated by TraDIS, we discovered five new pathogen genes, namely,  0281 ( []), , , , and , that contribute to necrotizing myositis and confirmed these findings using isogenic deletion-mutant strains. Taken together, our study results provide rich new information about the molecular events occurring in severe invasive infection of primate skeletal muscle that has extensive translational research implications. Necrotizing myositis caused by  has high morbidity and mortality rates and relatively few successful therapeutic options. In addition, there is no licensed human  vaccine. To gain enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of this infection, we employed a multidimensional analysis strategy that included dual RNA-seq and other data derived from experimental infection of nonhuman primates. The data were used to target five streptococcal genes for pathogenesis research, resulting in the unambiguous demonstration that these genes contribute to pathogen-host molecular interactions in necrotizing infections. We exploited fitness data derived from a recently conducted genome-wide transposon mutagenesis study to discover significant correlation between the magnitude of bacterial virulence gene expression  and pathogen fitness. Collectively, our findings have significant implications for translational research, potentially including vaccine efforts."

            "#text": "The  group comprises numerous closely related species, including bioterrorism agent , foodborne pathogen , and biopesticide  Differentiating organisms capable of causing illness or death from those used in industry is essential for risk assessment and outbreak preparedness. However, current species definitions facilitate species-phenotype incongruences, particularly when horizontally acquired genes are responsible for a phenotype. Using all publicly available  group genomes (= 2,231), we show that current species definitions lead to overlapping genomospecies clusters, in which 66.2% of genomes belong to multiple genomospecies at a conventional 95 average nucleotide identity (ANI) genomospecies threshold. A genomospecies threshold of ≈92.5 ANI is shown to reflect a natural gap in genome similarity for the  group, and medoid genomes identified at this threshold are shown to yield resolvable genomospecies clusters with minimal overlap (six of 2,231 genomes assigned to multiple genomospecies; 0.269%). We thus propose a nomenclatural framework for the  group which accounts for (i) genomospecies using resolvable genomospecies clusters obtained at ≈92.5 ANI, (ii) established lineages of medical importance using a formal collection of subspecies names, and (iii) heterogeneity of clinically and industrially important phenotypes using a formalized and extended collection of biovar terms. We anticipate that the proposed nomenclature will remain interpretable to clinicians, without sacrificing genomic species definitions, which can in turn aid in pathogen surveillance; early detection of emerging, high-risk genotypes; and outbreak preparedness. Historical species definitions for many prokaryotes, including pathogens, have relied on phenotypic characteristics that are inconsistent with genome evolution. This scenario forces microbiologists and clinicians to face a tradeoff between taxonomic rigor and clinical interpretability. Using the  group as a model, a conceptual framework for the taxonomic delineation of prokaryotes which reconciles genomic definitions of species with clinically and industrially relevant phenotypes is presented. The nomenclatural framework outlined here serves as a model for genomics-based bacterial taxonomy that moves beyond arbitrarily set genomospecies thresholds while maintaining congruence with phenotypes and historically important species names."

Gene sequences of 16S rRNA and the major surface antigen P51 of this new  species were distinct from those of all previously characterized  strains and  species, except for those from an uncharacterized  species culture isolate from a horse with PHF in northern Ohio in 1991. The new  species nonetheless had the characteristic intramolecular repeats within strain-specific antigen 3 (Ssa3), which were found in all sequenced Ssa3s of  strains. Experimental inoculation of two naive ponies with the new  species produced severe and subclinical PHF, respectively, and the bacteria were reisolated from both of them, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Serological assay titers against the new  species were higher than those against  Whole-genome sequence analysis of the new  species revealed unique features of this bacterium compared with  We propose to classify this new bacterium as  sp. nov.

            "#text": "Bacterial flagella are rotating nanomachines required for motility. Flagellar gene expression and protein secretion are coordinated for efficient flagellar biogenesis. Polar flagellates, unlike peritrichous bacteria, commonly order flagellar rod and hook gene transcription as a separate step after production of the MS ring, C ring, and flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) core proteins that form a competent fT3SS. Conserved regulatory mechanisms in diverse polar flagellates to create this polar flagellar transcriptional program have not been thoroughly assimilated. Using  and genetic analyses and our previous findings in  as a foundation, we observed a large subset of Gram-negative bacteria with the FlhF/FlhG regulatory system for polar flagellation to possess flagellum-associated two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs). We present data supporting a general theme in polar flagellates whereby MS ring, rotor, and fT3SS proteins contribute to a regulatory checkpoint during polar flagellar biogenesis. We demonstrate that  and  require the formation of this regulatory checkpoint for the TCSs to directly activate subsequent rod and hook gene transcription, which are hallmarks of the polar flagellar transcriptional program. By reprogramming transcription in  to more closely follow the peritrichous flagellar transcriptional program, we discovered a link between the polar flagellar transcription program and the activity of FlhF/FlhG flagellar biogenesis regulators in which the transcriptional program allows polar flagellates to continue to produce flagella for motility when FlhF or FlhG activity may be altered. Our findings integrate flagellar transcriptional and biogenesis regulatory processes involved in polar flagellation in many species. Relative to peritrichous bacteria, polar flagellates possess regulatory systems that order flagellar gene transcription differently and produce flagella in specific numbers only at poles. How transcriptional and flagellar biogenesis regulatory systems are interlinked to promote the correct synthesis of polar flagella in diverse species has largely been unexplored. We found evidence for many Gram-negative polar flagellates encoding two-component signal transduction systems with activity linked to the formation of flagellar type III secretion systems to enable production of flagellar rod and hook proteins at a discrete, subsequent stage during flagellar assembly. This polar flagellar transcriptional program assists, in some manner, the FlhF/FlhG flagellar biogenesis regulatory system, which forms specific flagellation patterns in polar flagellates in maintaining flagellation and motility when activity of FlhF or FlhG might be altered. Our work provides insight into the multiple regulatory processes required for polar flagellation."

However, there are major gaps in our understanding of the molecular events in bacterial cells that control how bacteria respond to phage predation. Using the model organism , we used two distinct genomic approaches, namely, transposon library screening and RNA sequencing, to investigate the interaction of  with a virulent phage. We discovered that a transcription factor encoding a LytR family response regulator controls the expression of enterococcal polysaccharide antigen () genes that are involved in phage infection and bacterial fitness. In addition, we discovered that DNA mismatch repair mutants rapidly evolve phage adsorption deficiencies, underpinning a molecular basis for  mutation during phage infection. Transcriptomic profiling of phage-infected  revealed broad transcriptional changes influencing viral replication and progeny burst size. We also demonstrate that phage infection alters the expression of bacterial genes associated with intra- and interbacterial interactions, including genes involved in quorum sensing and polymicrobial competition. Together, our results suggest that phage predation has the potential to influence complex microbial behavior and may dictate how bacteria respond to external environmental stimuli. These responses could have collateral effects (positive or negative) on microbial communities, such as the host microbiota, during phage therapy. We lack fundamental understanding of how phage infection influences bacterial gene expression and, consequently, how bacterial responses to phage infection affect the assembly of polymicrobial communities. Using parallel genomic approaches, we have discovered novel transcriptional regulators and metabolic genes that influence phage infection. The integration of whole-genome transcriptomic profiling during phage infection has revealed the differential regulation of genes important for group behaviors and polymicrobial interactions. Our work suggests that therapeutic phages could more broadly influence bacterial community composition outside their intended host targets."

Fundamental mechanisms by which  exacerbates HIV-1 infection are not clear. Here, we show that exosomes secreted by macrophages infected with , including drug-resistant clinical strains, reactivated HIV-1 by inducing oxidative stress. Mechanistically, -specific exosomes realigned mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and modulated the expression of host genes mediating oxidative stress response, inflammation, and HIV-1 transactivation. Proteomics analyses revealed the enrichment of several host factors (e.g., HIF-1α, galectins, and Hsp90) known to promote HIV-1 reactivation in -specific exosomes. Treatment with a known antioxidant-N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)-or with inhibitors of host factors-galectins and Hsp90-attenuated HIV-1 reactivation by specific exosomes. Our findings uncover new paradigms for understanding the redox and bioenergetics bases of HIV- coinfection, which will enable the design of effective therapeutic strategies. Globally, individuals coinfected with the AIDS virus (HIV-1) and with  (causative agent of tuberculosis [TB]) pose major obstacles in the clinical management of both diseases. At the heart of this issue is the apparent synergy between the two human pathogens. On the one hand, mechanisms induced by HIV-1 for reactivation of TB in AIDS patients are well characterized. On the other hand, while clinical findings clearly identified TB as a risk factor for HIV-1 reactivation and associated mortality, basic mechanisms by which  exacerbates HIV-1 replication and infection remain poorly characterized. The significance of our research is in identifying the role of fundamental mechanisms such as redox and energy metabolism in catalyzing HIV- synergy. The quantification of redox and respiratory parameters affected by  in stimulating HIV-1 will greatly enhance our understanding of HIV- coinfection, leading to a wider impact on the biomedical research community and creating new translational opportunities."

How host immune responses are orchestrated after alphaviral infections and lead to musculoskeletal inflammation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that myositis induced by Ross River virus (RRV) infection is driven by CD11b Ly6C inflammatory monocytes and followed by the establishment of a CD11b Ly6C CXCR1 macrophage population in the muscle upon recovery. Selective modulation of CD11b Ly6C monocyte migration to infected muscle using immune-modifying microparticles (IMP) reduced disease score, tissue damage, and inflammation and promoted the accumulation of CXCR1 macrophages, enhancing recovery and resolution. Here, we detail the role of immune pathology, describing a poorly characterized muscle macrophage subset as part of the dynamics of alphavirus-induced myositis and tissue recovery and identify IMP as an effective immunomodulatory approach. Given the lack of specific treatments available for alphavirus-induced pathologies, this study highlights a therapeutic potential for simple immune modulation by IMP in infected individuals in the event of large alphavirus outbreaks. Arthritogenic alphaviruses cause debilitating inflammatory disease, and current therapies are restricted to palliative approaches. Here, we show that following monocyte-driven muscle inflammation, tissue recovery is associated with the accumulation of CXCR1 macrophages in the muscle. Modulating inflammatory monocyte infiltration using immune-modifying microparticles (IMP) reduced tissue damage and inflammation and enhanced the formation of tissue repair-associated CXCR1 macrophages in the muscle. This shows that modulating key effectors of viral inflammation using microparticles can alter the outcome of disease by facilitating the accumulation of macrophage subsets associated with tissue repair."

            "#text": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) establishes lifelong infections in humans, a process that relies on its ability to thwart innate and adaptive immune defenses of the host. Recently, we reported that HIV-1 infection results in a dramatic reduction of the cellular peroxisome pool. Peroxisomes are metabolic organelles that also function as signaling platforms in the innate immune response. Here, we show that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu is necessary and sufficient for the depletion of cellular peroxisomes during infection. Vpu induces the expression of four microRNAs that target mRNAs encoding proteins required for peroxisome formation and metabolic function. The ability of Vpu to downregulate peroxisomes was found to be dependent upon the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Given the importance of peroxisomes in innate immune signaling and central nervous system function, the roles of Vpu in dampening antiviral signaling appear to be more diverse than previously realized. Finally, our findings highlight a potential role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in peroxisome homeostasis through modulating the production of biogenesis factors. People living with HIV can experience accelerated aging and the development of neurological disorders. Recently, we reported that HIV-1 infection results in a dramatic loss of peroxisomes in macrophages and brain tissue. This is significant because (i) peroxisomes are important for the innate immune response and (ii) loss of peroxisome function is associated with cellular aging and neurodegeneration. Accordingly, understanding how HIV-1 infection causes peroxisome depletion may provide clues regarding how the virus establishes persistent infections and, potentially, the development of neurological disorders. Here, we show that the accessory protein Vpu is necessary and sufficient for the induction of microRNAs that target peroxisome biogenesis factors. The ability of Vpu to downregulate peroxisome formation depends on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Thus, in addition to revealing a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 uses intracellular signaling pathways to target antiviral signaling platforms (peroxisomes), we have uncovered a previously unknown link between the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and peroxisome homeostasis."

Treatment of the Pacific oyster () with the double-stranded RNA analog poly(I·C) confers long-term protection against infection with ostreid herpesvirus 1, the causative agent of Pacific oyster mortality syndrome. In a recent article in , Lafont and coauthors (M. Lafont, A. Vergnes, J. Vidal-Dupiol, J. de Lorgeril, et al., mBio 11:e02777-19, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.02777-19) characterized the transcriptome of oysters treated with poly(I·C). This immune stimulator induced genes related to the interferon and apoptosis pathways. This response overlaps the response to viral infection, and high expression levels of potential effector genes are maintained for up to 4 months. This work opens the door to characterization of the phenomena of immune priming in a poorly studied invertebrate model. It also highlights the importance of interferon-like responses for invertebrate antiviral immunity."

            "#text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects millions of people worldwide, causing chronic liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplant. In the last several years, the advent of direct-acting antivirals, including NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PIs), has remarkably improved treatment outcomes of HCV-infected patients. However, selection of resistance-associated substitutions and polymorphisms among genotypes can lead to drug resistance and in some cases treatment failure. A proactive strategy to combat resistance is to constrain PIs within evolutionarily conserved regions in the protease active site. Designing PIs using the substrate envelope is a rational strategy to decrease the susceptibility to resistance by using the constraints of substrate recognition. We successfully designed two series of HCV NS3/4A PIs to leverage unexploited areas in the substrate envelope to improve potency, specifically against resistance-associated substitutions at D168. Our design strategy achieved better resistance profiles over both the FDA-approved NS3/4A PI grazoprevir and the parent compound against the clinically relevant D168A substitution. Crystallographic structural analysis and inhibition assays confirmed that optimally filling the substrate envelope is critical to improve inhibitor potency while avoiding resistance. Specifically, inhibitors that enhanced hydrophobic packing in the S4 pocket and avoided an energetically frustrated pocket performed the best. Thus, the HCV substrate envelope proved to be a powerful tool to design robust PIs, offering a strategy that can be translated to other targets for rational design of inhibitors with improved potency and resistance profiles. Despite significant progress, hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to be a major health problem with millions of people infected worldwide and thousands dying annually due to resulting complications. Recent antiviral combinations can achieve >95% cure, but late diagnosis, low access to treatment, and treatment failure due to drug resistance continue to be roadblocks against eradication of the virus. We report the rational design of two series of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors with improved resistance profiles by exploiting evolutionarily constrained regions of the active site using the substrate envelope model. Optimally filling the S4 pocket is critical to avoid resistance and improve potency. Our results provide drug design strategies to avoid resistance that are applicable to other quickly evolving viral drug targets."

            "#text": "Much of the diversity of prokaryotic genomes is contributed by the tightly controlled recombination activity of transposons (Tns). The Tn family is arguably one of the most widespread transposon families. Members carry a large range of passenger genes incorporated into their structures. Family members undergo replicative transposition using a DDE transposase to generate a cointegrate structure which is then resolved by site-specific recombination between specific DNA sequences () on each of the two Tn copies in the cointegrate. These sites also carry promoters controlling expression of the recombinase and transposase. We report here that a number of Tn members encode a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, typically composed of a stable toxin and a labile antitoxin that binds the toxin and inhibits its lethal activity. This system serves to improve plasmid maintenance in a bacterial population and, until recently, was believed to be associated with bacterial persistence. At least six different TA gene pairs are associated with various Tn members. Our data suggest that several independent acquisition events have occurred. In contrast to most Tn family passenger genes, which are generally located away from the transposition module, the TA gene pairs abut the  site upstream of the resolvase genes. Although their role when part of Tn family transposons is unclear, this finding suggests a potential role for the embedded TA in stabilizing the associated transposon with the possibility that TA expression is coupled to expression of transposase and resolvase during the transposition process itself. Transposable elements (TEs) are important in genetic diversification due to their recombination properties and their ability to promote horizontal gene transfer. Over the last decades, much effort has been made to understand TE transposition mechanisms and their impact on prokaryotic genomes. For example, the Tn family is ubiquitous in bacteria, molding their host genomes by the paste-and-copy mechanism. In addition to the transposition module, Tn members often carry additional passenger genes (e.g., conferring antibiotic or heavy metal resistance and virulence), and three were previously known to carry a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system often associated with plasmid maintenance; however, the role of TA systems within the Tn family is unknown. The genetic context of TA systems in Tn members suggests that they may play a regulatory role in ensuring stable invasion of these Tns during transposition."

The zoonotic bacterium , the causative agent of brucellosis, delivers effector proteins via its VirB type IV secretion system (T4SS) which mediate biogenesis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived replicative -containing vacuole (rBCV). Here, we show that T4SS effectors BspB and RicA display epistatic interactions in  replication.

Expression of RicA impaired host secretion and caused Golgi fragmentation. While BspB-mediated changes in ER-to-Golgi transport were independent of RicA and Rab2a, BspB-driven alterations in Golgi vesicular traffic also involved RicA and Rab2a, defining BspB and RicA's functional interplay at the Golgi interface. Altogether, these findings support a model where RicA modulation of Rab2a functions impairs  replication but is compensated by BspB-mediated remodeling of Golgi apparatus-associated vesicular transport, revealing an epistatic interaction between these T4SS effectors. Bacterial pathogens with an intracellular lifestyle modulate many host cellular processes to promote their infectious cycle. They do so by delivering effector proteins into host cells via dedicated secretion systems that target specific host functions. While the roles of many individual effectors are known, how their modes of action are coordinated is rarely understood. Here, we show that the zoonotic bacterium  delivers the BspB effector that mitigates the negative effect on bacterial replication that the RicA effector exerts via modulation of the host small GTPase Rab2. These findings provide an example of functional integration between bacterial effectors that promotes proliferation of pathogens."

For , protein homeostasis also modulates the transition between yeast and filamentous forms, which is critical for virulence. A key regulator of morphogenesis is the molecular chaperone Hsp90, which mediates proteostasis under physiological and stress conditions. Hsp90 regulates morphogenesis by repressing cyclic AMP-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) signaling, such that inhibition of Hsp90 causes filamentation in the absence of an inducing cue. We explored the effect of perturbation of another facet of protein homeostasis and discovered that morphogenesis is also regulated by the proteasome, a large 33-subunit protein complex consisting of a 20S catalytic core and two 19S regulatory particles, which controls degradation of intracellular proteins.

Filaments induced by inhibition of either the proteasome or Hsp90 have shared structural characteristics, such as aberrant nuclear content, and shared genetic dependencies, such as intact cAMP-PKA signaling. Consistent with a functional connection between these facets of protein homeostasis that modulate morphogenesis, we observed that proteasome inhibition results in an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins that overwhelm Hsp90 function, relieving Hsp90-mediated repression of morphogenesis.

A key trait that enables  virulence is its ability to transition between yeast and filamentous forms. Understanding the mechanisms regulating this virulence trait can facilitate the development of much-needed, novel therapeutic strategies. A key regulator of morphogenesis is the molecular chaperone Hsp90, which is crucial for proteostasis. Here, we expanded our understanding of how proteostasis regulates fungal morphogenesis and identified the proteasome as a repressor of filamentation in  and related species. Our work suggests that proteasome inhibition overwhelms Hsp90 function, thereby inducing morphogenesis.

A colony of social ants consists of various castes that exhibit distinct lifestyles and is, thus, a unique model for investigating how symbionts may be involved in host eusociality. Yet our knowledge of social ant-symbiont dynamics has remained rudimentary. Through 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing of the carpenter ant  symbiont community across various castes, we here report caste-dependent diversity of commensal gut microbiota and lineage divergence of \" Blochmannia,\" an obligate endosymbiont. While most prevalent gut-associated bacterial populations are found across all castes (, , , and ), we also discovered uncultured populations that are found only in males (belonging to , , and ). Most of those populations are not detected in laboratory-maintained queens and workers, suggesting that they are facultative gut symbionts introduced via environmental acquisition. Further inspection of \" Blochmannia\" endosymbionts reveals that two populations are dominant in all individuals across all castes but that males preferentially contain two different sublineages that are diversified from others. Clearly, each caste has distinct symbiont communities, suggesting an overlooked biological aspect of host-symbiont interaction in social insects. Social animals, such as primates and some insects, have been shown to exchange symbiotic microbes among individuals through sharing diet or habitats, resulting in increased consistency of microbiota among social partners. The ant is a representative of social insects exhibiting various castes within a colony; queens, males, and nonreproductive females (so-called workers) show distinct morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors but tightly interact with each other in the nest. However, how this social context affects their gut microbiota has remained unclear. In this study, we deeply sequenced the gut symbiont community across various castes of the carpenter ant  We report caste-dependent diversity of commensal gut microbial community and lineage divergence of the mutualistic endosymbiont \" Blochmannia.\" This report sheds light on the hidden diversity in microbial populations and community structure associated with guts of males in social ants."

Early studies of the urinary microbiota preferentially used samples obtained by transurethral catheterization to minimize vulvovaginal microbial contributions. Whereas voided specimens are preferred for longitudinal studies, the few studies that reported longitudinal data were limited to women with lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms, due to ease of accessing a clinical population for sampling and the impracticality and risk of collecting repeated catheterized urine specimens in a nonclinical population. Here, we studied the microbiota of the LUT of nonsymptomatic, premenopausal women using midstream voided urine (MSU) specimens to investigate relationships between microbial dynamics and personal factors. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and a metaculturomics method called xpanded uantitative rine ulture (EQUC), we characterized the microbiotas of MSU and periurethral swab specimens collected daily for approximately 3 months from a small cohort of adult women. Participants were screened for eligibility, including the ability to self-collect paired urogenital specimens prior to enrollment. In this population, we found that measures of microbial dynamics related to specific participant-reported factors, particularly menstruation and vaginal intercourse. Further investigation of the trends revealed differences in the composition and diversity of LUT microbiotas within and across participants. These data, in combination with previous studies showing relationships between the LUT microbiota and LUT symptoms, suggest that personal factors relating to the genitourinary system may be an important consideration in the etiology, prevention, and/or treatment of LUT disorders. Following the discovery of the collective human urinary microbiota, important knowledge gaps remain, including the stability and variability of this microbial niche over time. Initial urinary studies preferentially utilized samples obtained by transurethral catheterization to minimize contributions from vulvovaginal microbes. However, catheterization has the potential to alter the urinary microbiota; therefore, voided specimens are preferred for longitudinal studies. In this report, we describe microbial findings obtained by daily assessment over 3 months in a small cohort of adult women. We found that, similarly to vaginal microbiotas, lower urinary tract (LUT) microbiotas are dynamic, with changes relating to several factors, particularly menstruation and vaginal intercourse. Our study results show that LUT microbiotas are both dynamic and resilient. They also offer novel opportunities to target LUT microbiotas by preventative or therapeutic means, through risk and/or protective factor modification."

            "#text": "Cold seeps and hydrothermal vents deliver large amounts of methane and other gaseous alkanes into marine surface sediments. Consortia of archaea and partner bacteria thrive on the oxidation of these alkanes and its coupling to sulfate reduction. The inherently slow growth of the involved organisms and the lack of pure cultures have impeded the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of archaeal alkane degradation. Here, using hydrothermal sediments of the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) and ethane as the substrate, we cultured microbial consortia of a novel anaerobic ethane oxidizer, \" Ethanoperedens thermophilum\" (GoM-Arc1 clade), and its partner bacterium \" Desulfofervidus auxilii,\" previously known from methane-oxidizing consortia. The sulfate reduction activity of the culture doubled within one week, indicating a much faster growth than in any other alkane-oxidizing archaea described before. The dominance of a single archaeal phylotype in this culture allowed retrieval of a closed genome of \" Ethanoperedens,\" a sister genus of the recently reported ethane oxidizer \" Argoarchaeum.\" The metagenome-assembled genome of \" Ethanoperedens\" encoded a complete methanogenesis pathway including a methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) that is highly divergent from those of methanogens and methanotrophs. Combined substrate and metabolite analysis showed ethane as the sole growth substrate and production of ethyl-coenzyme M as the activation product. Stable isotope probing demonstrated that the enzymatic mechanism of ethane oxidation in \" Ethanoperedens\" is fully reversible; thus, its enzymatic machinery has potential for the biotechnological development of microbial ethane production from carbon dioxide. In the seabed, gaseous alkanes are oxidized by syntrophic microbial consortia that thereby reduce fluxes of these compounds into the water column. Because of the immense quantities of seabed alkane fluxes, these consortia are key catalysts of the global carbon cycle. Due to their obligate syntrophic lifestyle, the physiology of alkane-degrading archaea remains poorly understood. We have now cultivated a thermophilic, relatively fast-growing ethane oxidizer in partnership with a sulfate-reducing bacterium known to aid in methane oxidation and have retrieved the first complete genome of a short-chain alkane-degrading archaeon. This will greatly enhance the understanding of nonmethane alkane activation by noncanonical methyl-coenzyme M reductase enzymes and provide insights into additional metabolic steps and the mechanisms underlying syntrophic partnerships. Ultimately, this knowledge could lead to the biotechnological development of alkanogenic microorganisms to support the carbon neutrality of industrial processes."

Several fungi were shown to utilize free heme, and , a major opportunistic pathogen, is able both to capture free heme and to extract heme from hemoglobin using a network of extracellular hemophores. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant host heme-scavenging protein.

In contrast, hemopexin, a low-abundance but high-affinity heme-scavenging serum protein, does inhibit heme utilization by  However, inhibition by hemopexin is mitigated in the presence of HSA. Utilization of albumin-bound heme requires the same hemophore cascade as that which mediates hemoglobin-iron utilization. Accordingly, we found that the  hemophores are able to extract heme bound to HSA  Since many common drugs are known to bind to HSA, we tested whether they could interfere with heme-iron utilization.

Heme constitutes a major iron source for microorganisms and particularly for pathogenic microbes; to overcome the iron scarcity in the animal host, many pathogenic bacteria and fungi have developed systems to extract and take up heme from host proteins such as hemoglobin. Microbial heme uptake mechanisms are usually studied using growth media containing free heme or hemoglobin as a sole iron source. However, the animal host contains heme-scavenging proteins that could prevent this uptake. In the human host in particular, the most abundant serum heme-binding protein is albumin. Surprisingly, however, we found that in the case of fungi of the  species family, albumin promoted rather than prevented heme utilization. Albumin thus constitutes a human-specific factor that can affect heme-iron utilization and could serve as target for preventing heme-iron utilization by fungal pathogens. As a proof of principle, we identify two drugs that can inhibit albumin-stimulated heme utilization."

            "#text": "Channelrhodopsins guide algal phototaxis and are widely used as optogenetic probes for control of membrane potential with light. \"Bacteriorhodopsin-like\" cation channelrhodopsins (BCCRs) from cryptophytes differ in primary structure from other CCRs, lacking usual residues important for their cation conductance. Instead, the sequences of BCCR match more closely those of rhodopsin proton pumps, containing residues responsible for critical proton transfer reactions. We report 19 new BCCRs which, together with the earlier 6 known members of this family, form three branches (subfamilies) of a phylogenetic tree. Here, we show that the conductance mechanisms in two subfamilies differ with respect to involvement of the homolog of the proton donor in rhodopsin pumps. Two BCCRs from the genus  generate photocurrents that rapidly desensitize under continuous illumination. Using a combination of patch clamp electrophysiology, absorption, Raman spectroscopy, and flash photolysis, we found that the desensitization is due to rapid accumulation of a long-lived nonconducting intermediate of the photocycle with unusually blue-shifted absorption with a maximum at 330 nm. These observations reveal diversity within the BCCR family and contribute to deeper understanding of their independently evolved cation channel function. Cation channelrhodopsins, light-gated channels from flagellate green algae, are extensively used as optogenetic photoactivators of neurons in research and recently have progressed to clinical trials for vision restoration. However, the molecular mechanisms of their photoactivation remain poorly understood. We recently identified cryptophyte cation channelrhodopsins, structurally different from those of green algae, which have separately evolved to converge on light-gated cation conductance. This study reveals diversity within this new protein family and describes a subclade with unusually rapid desensitization that results in short transient photocurrents in continuous light. Such transient currents have not been observed in the green algae channelrhodopsins and are potentially useful in optogenetic protocols. Kinetic UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and photoelectrophysiology reveal that the desensitization is caused by rapid accumulation of a nonconductive photointermediate in the photochemical reaction cycle. The absorption maximum of the intermediate is 330 nm, the shortest wavelength reported in any rhodopsin, indicating a novel chromophore structure."

Identification of host factors that modulate LTR activity and viral latency may help develop new antiretroviral therapies. The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are known to regulate gene expression and possess multiple physiological functions. hnRNP family members have recently been identified as the sensors for viral nucleic acids to induce antiviral responses, highlighting the crucial roles of hnRNPs in regulating viral infection. A member of the hnRNP family, X-linked RNA-binding motif protein (RBMX), has been identified in this study as a novel HIV-1 restriction factor that modulates HIV-1 5'-LTR-driven transcription of viral genome in CD4 T cells. Mechanistically, RBMX binds to HIV-1 proviral DNA at the LTR downstream region and maintains the repressive trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3), leading to a blockage of the recruitment of the positive transcription factor phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and consequential impediment of transcription elongation. This RBMX-mediated modulation of HIV-1 transcription maintains viral latency by inhibiting viral reactivation from an integrated proviral DNA. Our findings provide a new understanding of how host factors modulate HIV-1 infection and latency and suggest a potential new target for the development of HIV-1 therapies. HIV-1 latency featuring silence of transcription from HIV-1 proviral DNA represents a major obstacle for HIV-1 eradication.

Nevertheless, it remains poorly investigated how viral pathogens modulate biogenesis or function of peroxisomes to evade innate sensing and restriction. In a recent study, Hobman and colleagues found that the accessory viral protein u (Vpu) of HIV-1 inhibits peroxisome activity by depleting cellular peroxisome pools. This depletion could be ascribed to a Vpu-dependent induction of four microRNAs (miRNAs) that suppress the expression of peroxisomal biogenesis factors PEX2, PEX7, PEX11B, and PEX13. Although the downstream effects on antiretroviral gene expression and HIV-1 replication remain to be determined, these findings provide important insights into peroxisome biogenesis and the modulation of cell organelles by HIV-1 Vpu.",

            "#text": "A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was recently identified as the causative agent for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak that has generated a global health crisis. We use a combination of genomic analysis and sensitive profile-based sequence and structure analysis to understand the potential pathogenesis determinants of this virus. As a result, we identify several fast-evolving genomic regions that might be at the interface of virus-host interactions, corresponding to the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein, the three tandem Macro fold domains in ORF1a, and the uncharacterized protein ORF8. Further, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha- and beta-CoVs belong to novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished by being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert, and having a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover numerous Ig domain proteins from several unrelated metazoan viruses, which are distinct in sequence and structure but share comparable architectures to those of the CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and other previously unidentified CoV Ig domain proteins fall under the umbrella of a widespread strategy of deployment of Ig domain proteins in animal viruses as pathogenicity factors that modulate host immunity. The rapid evolution of the ORF8 Ig domain proteins points to a potential evolutionary arms race between viruses and hosts, likely arising from immune pressure, and suggests a role in transmission between distinct host species. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic strongly emphasizes the need for a more complete understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of its causative agent SARS-CoV-2. Despite intense scrutiny, several proteins encoded by the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like coronaviruses remain enigmatic. Moreover, the high infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 in certain individuals make wet-lab studies currently challenging. In this study, we used a series of computational strategies to identify several fast-evolving regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins which are potentially under host immune pressure. Most notably, the hitherto-uncharacterized protein encoded by ORF8 is one of them. Using sensitive sequence and structural analysis methods, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha- and beta-coronavirus comprise novel families of immunoglobulin domain proteins, which might function as potential immune modulators to delay or attenuate the host immune response against the viruses."

            "#text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused a severe, international shortage of N95 respirators, which are essential to protect health care providers from infection. Given the contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To be effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator without impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this work, we describe a microwave-generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in health care systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1,100-W commercially available microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology against MS2 phage, a highly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we report an average 6-log plaque-forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log PFU (99.999%) reduction after a single 3-min microwave treatment. Notably, quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means of effective decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers facing urgent need. Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an increasing shortage of protective gear necessary to keep health care providers safe from infection. As of 9 April 2020, the CDC reported 9,282 cumulative cases of COVID-19 among U.S. health care workers (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 69:477-481, 2020, https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e6). N95 respirators are recommended by the CDC as the ideal method of protection from COVID-19. Although N95 respirators are traditionally single use, the shortages have necessitated the need for reuse. Effective methods of N95 decontamination that do not affect the fit or filtration ability of N95 respirators are essential. Numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist; however, none are universally accessible. In this study, we describe an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators using widely available materials. The N95 decontamination method described in this work will provide a valuable resource for hospitals, health care centers, and outpatient practices that are experiencing increasing shortages of N95 respirators due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

            "#text": "To date, limited genetic changes in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome have been described. Here, we report a 382-nucleotide (nt) deletion in SARS-CoV-2 that truncates open reading frame 7b (ORF7b) and ORF8, removing the ORF8 transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) and eliminating ORF8 transcription. The earliest 382-nt deletion variant was detected in Singapore on 29 January 2020, with the deletion viruses circulating in the country and accounting for 23.6% (45/191) of SARS-CoV-2 samples screened in this study. SARS-CoV-2 with the same deletion has since been detected in Taiwan, and other ORF7b/8 deletions of various lengths, ranging from 62 nt to 345 nt, have been observed in other geographic locations, including Australia, Bangladesh, and Spain. Mutations or deletions in ORF8 of SARS-CoV have been associated with reduced replicative fitness and virus attenuation. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 382-nt deletion viruses showed significantly higher replicative fitness  than the wild type, while no difference was observed in patient viral load, indicating that the deletion variant viruses retained their replicative fitness. A robust antibody response to ORF8 has been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the emergence of ORF8 deletions may be due to immune-driven selection and that further deletion variants may emerge during the sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. During the SARS epidemic in 2003/2004, a number of deletions were observed in ORF8 of SARS-CoV, and eventually deletion variants became predominant, leading to the hypothesis that ORF8 was an evolutionary hot spot for adaptation of SARS-CoV to humans. However, due to the successful control of the SARS epidemic, the importance of these deletions for the epidemiological fitness of SARS-CoV in humans could not be established. The emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains with ORF8 deletions, combined with evidence of a robust immune response to ORF8, suggests that the lack of ORF8 may assist with host immune evasion. In addition to providing a key insight into the evolutionary behavior of SARS-CoV-2 as the virus adapts to its new human hosts, the emergence of ORF8 deletion variants may also impact vaccination strategies."

        "Abstract": "There is high mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected individuals with chronic inflammatory diseases, like obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. A cytokine storm in some patients after infection contributes to this mortality. In addition to lungs, the intestine is targeted during COVID-19 infection. The intestinal membrane serves as a barrier to prevent leakage of microorganisms and their products into the bloodstream; however, dietary fats can affect the gut microbiome and may increase intestinal permeability. In obese or diabetic individuals, there is an increase in the abundance of either Gram-negative bacteria in the gut or their product, endotoxin, in systemic circulation. We speculate that when the COVID-19 infection localizes in the intestine and when the permeability properties of the intestinal membrane are compromised, an inflammatory response is generated when proinflammatory endotoxin, produced by resident Gram-negative bacteria, leaks into the systemic circulation. This review discusses conditions contributing to inflammation that are triggered by microbially derived factors from the gut.",

Currently, a few families of antifungals are available to fight aspergillosis, and we are facing a worrisome increase in resistance to azoles, the drugs used for both first-line treatment and prophylaxis of invasive aspergillosis. In this context, some of the latest antifungals, i.e., echinocandins, have gained attention. Even though acquired resistance to echinocandins is yet uncommon in  clinical isolates, some strains exhibit another characteristic that relies on their capacity to grow at suprainhibitory echinocandin concentrations  This intriguing phenomenon, especially observed with caspofungin and now referred to as the caspofungin paradoxical effect (CPE), relies on molecular mechanisms that were hitherto little understood. Here, we discuss the recent key findings of Valero and colleagues published in  (C. Valero, A. C. Colabardini, J. Chiaratto, L.
