Neuromuscular blocking agents may facilitate mechanical ventilation and improve oxygenation, but may result in prolonged recovery of neuromuscular function and acute quadriplegic myopathy syndrome (AQMS). The goal of this study was to address a hypothetical question via computer modeling: Would a reduction in intubation time of 6 hours and/or a reduction in the incidence of AQMS from 25% to 21%, provide enough benefit to justify a drug with an additional expenditure of $267 (the difference in acquisition cost between a generic and brand name neuromuscular blocker)?"

In its advanced forms it carries severe outcomes and can lead to death. It is thus important to detect the disease as early as possible, which can help devise effective intervention and treatment plan. Here we investigate ways to utilize information available in electronic health records (EHRs) from regular office visits of more than 13,000 patients, in order to distinguish among several stages of the disease. While clinical data stored in EHRs provide valuable information for risk-stratification, one of the major challenges in using them arises from data imbalance. That is, records associated with a more severe condition are typically under-represented compared to those associated with a milder manifestation of the disease. To address imbalance, we propose and develop a sampling-based ensemble approach, hierarchical meta-classification, aiming to stratify CKD patients into severity stages, using simple quantitative non-text features gathered from standard office visit records."

However, an increased reliance on EMR has also led to a corresponding increase in the negative impact exerted via EMR breaches possibly leading to unexpected damage for both hospitals and patients. This study investigated the possible antecedents that will influence hospital employees' continuance compliance with privacy policy of Electronic Medical Records (EMR). This is done from both motivational and habitual perspectives; specifically, we investigated the mediating role of habit between motivation and continuance compliance intention with EMR privacy policy."

In the case of an Austrian hospital network, problem list entries are limited to fifty characters and are potentially linked to ICD-10. The requirement of producing ICD codes at each hospital stay, together with the length limitation of list items leads to highly redundant problem lists, which conflicts with the physicians' need of getting a good overview of a patient in short time.

Extensive research has gone into this subject, but has yielded contradictory findings. We propose an algorithm for detecting both association and causation relationships given a discrete sequence of events, which we believe will be useful in addressing the validity of the gateway hypothesis. To assess the gateway hypothesis, we developed the GatewayNet algorithm, a refinement of sequential rule mining called initiation rule mining. After a brief mathematical definition, we describe how to perform initiation rule mining and how to infer causal relationships from its rules (\"gateway rules\"). We tested GatewayNet against data for which relationships were known. After constructing a transaction database using a first-order Markov chain, we mined it to produce a gateway network. We then discuss various incarnations of the gateway network. We then evaluated the performance of GatewayNet on urine drug screening data collected from the emergency department at LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport. A de-identified database of urine drug screenings ordered by the department between August 1998 and June 2011 was collected and then restricted to patients having at least one screening succeeding their first positive drug screening result."

Despite the known importance of being physically active, patient adherence to exercise, both in daily life and during cardiac rehabilitation (CR), is low. Patient adherence is frequently composed of numerous determinants associated with different patient aspects (e.g., psychological, clinical, etc.). Understanding the influence of such determinants is a central component of developing personalized interventions to improve or maintain patient adherence. Medical research produced evidence regarding factors affecting patients' adherence to physical activity regimen. However, the heterogeneity of the available data is a significant challenge for knowledge reusability. Ontologies constitute one of the methods applied for efficient knowledge sharing and reuse. In this paper, we are proposing an ontology called OPTImAL, focusing on CVD patient adherence to physical activity and exercise training."

A real-world clinical dataset with ICD-10 coded diagnoses and hospital length of stay (HLOS) information was used to evaluate the performance of various algorithms and their combinations in predicting whether a patient need long-term hospitalization or not. Four subpopulation prototypes that were defined based on age and HLOS with different diagnoses set sizes were used as the target for similarity analysis.

In terms of accuracy, specificity, and precision, the decision tree generated by HDTTCA provides a better performance than that of the logistic regression model. When HDTTCA is applied, the decision tree model generates a competitive performance and provides clear, easily understandable rules.

Rehabilitation after stroke is an area of mutual interest for health care in many countries. Within the health care sector there is a growing emphasis on ICT services to provide clients with easier access to information, self-evaluation, and self-management. ICT-supported care programs possible to use in clients' home environments are also recommended when there are long distances to the health care specialists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical usability of a SMS-based reminder system as well as user opinions when using such a system to assist clients to remember to perform daily rehabilitation activities, to rate their performance and to allow Occupational therapists (OT's) to track and follow-up clients' results over time."

We show defining stillbirths' rate as a proportion of live births enhances stillbirths' importance, especially in poorer countries; negates some of its under-statement vis-a-vis neonatal mortality rate, accentuates its decrease; and permits inference about relative magnitudes of stillbirths and neonatal mortality from the two rates. Using it, we derive stillbirths adjusted life expectancy, and suggest it reflects a more complete and accurate measure of comparative life expectancies of different countries.

This is particularly an issue as multiple conditions share the similar etiologies to malaria, including brucellosis, a rare, under-detected zoonosis.

However, the literature shows that there is considerable room for improvement of CDSSs, in particular by increasing the clinical relevance of the pDDI alerts they generate and thereby reducing alert fatigue. However, consensus on which pDDIs are clinically relevant in the ICU setting is lacking.

No differences in guideline adherence were found between the two groups. Respondents in the intervention and control groups spent, on average, 115 and 153 min respectively seeking relevant information presented in the guideline."

In the user needs phase, T2D Screening and solution T2D Care at population level share similar priorities, as both deal with risk-stratification. End-users of T2D Screening and solution T2D Care at individual level prioritize easiness of use and satisfaction, while managers prefer the tools to be available every time and everywhere. In the implementation phase, three Use Cases were defined for T2D Screening, adapting the tool to different settings and granularity of information. Two Use Cases were defined around solutions T2D Care at population and T2D Care at individual, to be used in primary or secondary care. Suitable filtering options were equipped with \"attractive\" visual analytics to focus the attention of end-users on specific parameters and events. In the evaluation phase, good levels of user experience versus bad level of usability suggest that end-users of T2D Screening perceived the potential, but they are worried about complexity.

Deciding about breast reconstruction is complex and the preference-sensitive nature of this decision requires an approach of shared decision making between patient and doctor. Women considering breast reconstruction have expressed a need for decision support. We developed an online patient decision aid (pDA) to support decision making in women considering immediate breast reconstruction. The primary aim of this study is to assess the impact of the pDA in reducing decisional conflict, and more generally, on the decision-making process and the decision quality. Additionally, we will investigate the pDA's impact on health outcomes, explore predictors, and assess its cost-effectiveness."

First the removal of pregnant patients and children from the classification process was investigated but this diminished the workload reduction achieved. The optimal solution was found to be three Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithms, trained independently for the classification of pregnant patients, children, and then all other patients. When combined, this system granted a relative workload reduction of 41% and a sensitivity of 95% for each of the stratified patient groups."

Relevant data must be considered highly sensitive and it needs to be protected from unauthorized use and re-identification. In this context, laws, regulations, guidelines and best-practices often recommend or mandate pseudonymization, which means that directly identifying data of subjects (e.g. names and addresses) is stored separately from data which is primarily needed for scientific analyses."

For example, data stored in distributed databases, need to be dynamically combined with each other, which requires additional interfaces for communicating between the various subsystems. This increased complexity may lead to new attack vectors for intruders. Obviously, this is in contrast to the objective of improving data protection. What is lacking is a standardized process of evaluating and reporting risks, threats and countermeasures, which can be used to test whether integrating pseudonymization methods into data collection systems actually improves upon the degree of protection provided by system designs that simply follow common IT security best practices and implement fine-grained role-based access control models. To demonstrate that the methods used to describe systems employing pseudonymized data management are currently heterogeneous and ad-hoc, we examined the extent to which twelve recent studies address each of the six basic security properties defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 27,000. We show inconsistencies across the studies, with most of them failing to mention one or more security properties."

Second, by embedding the proposed Squeeze-Excitation-Pruning (SEP) block into our hybrid model, the channel importance can be learned and the redundant channels are thus removed.

Thereby, body and ambient temperatures are measured at the death scene to estimate a time of death based on a number of assumptions, such as initial body temperature and stable ambient temperature. While so far, practical use of the method resorted to paper print outs or copies of a nomogram using a ruler, increasingly, users are interested in computer or mobile device applications. We developed a computational solution that has been available online as a web accessible PHP program since 2005. From that, we have received numerous requests not so much to detail our code but to explain how to efficiently approximate the solution to the Henssge equation."

Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, we conduct an exhaustive search of all available feature variables within the data to develop models for cardiovascular, prediabetes, and diabetes detection. Using different time-frames and feature sets for the data (based on laboratory data), multiple machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting) were evaluated on their classification performance. The models were then combined to develop a weighted ensemble model, capable of leveraging the performance of the disparate models to improve detection accuracy. Information gain of tree-based models was used to identify the key variables within the patient data that contributed to the detection of at-risk patients in each of the diseases classes by the data-learned models."

In 2009, the Ministry of Health of China launched the China national stroke screening and intervention program, which screens stroke and its risk factors and conducts high-risk population interventions for people aged above 40 years old all over China. In this program, stroke risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, lack of exercise, apparently overweight and family history of stroke. People with more than two risk factors or history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are considered as high-risk. However, it is impossible for this criterion to classify stroke risk levels for people with unknown values in fields of risk factors. The missing of stroke risk levels results in reduced efficiency of stroke interventions and inaccuracies in statistical results at the national level. In this paper, we use 2017 national stroke screening data to develop stroke risk classification models based on machine learning algorithms to improve the classification efficiency."

In particular, medical specialists refer to the MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society - sponsored revision of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) that is the most widely used clinical scale for PD rating. However, clinical scales rely on the observation of some subtle motor phenomena that are either difficult to capture with human eyes or could be misclassified. This limitation motivated several researchers to develop intelligent systems based on machine learning algorithms able to automatically recognize the PD. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies investigated the classification between healthy subjects and PD patients without considering the automatic rating of different levels of severity."

In order to investigate the motor abilities of the upper and lower body, we acquired and analyzed three main motor tasks: (1) gait, (2) finger tapping, and (3) foot tapping.

Currently, telemedicine is mostly used for patients who have difficulty attending medical consultations because of where they live (teleconsultation) or for specialist referrals when no specialist of a given discipline is locally available (telexpertise). However, the use of specific equipment (with dedicated cameras, screens, and computers) and the need for institutional infrastructure made the deployment and use of these systems expensive and rigid. Although many telemedicine systems have been tested, most have not generally gone beyond local projects. Our hypothesis is that the use of smartphones will allow health care providers to overcome some of the limitations that we have exposed, thus allowing the generalization of telemedicine."

By developing the example of France, this article analyses the reasons most commonly put forth: the administrative and legal difficulties, and the lack of funding. We argue that the real reason telemedicine struggled to find its place was because the technology was not close enough to the patient."

To realize this, machine learning models can be trained to make predictions from clinical, paraclinical and biomolecular data. In this process, privacy protection and regulatory requirements need careful consideration, as the resulting models may leak sensitive personal information. To counter this threat, a wide range of methods for integrating machine learning with formal methods of privacy protection have been proposed. However, there is a significant lack of practical tools to create and evaluate such privacy-preserving models. In this software article, we report on our ongoing efforts to bridge this gap."

Our methods are particularly well suited for applications in biomedicine, as they preserve the truthfulness of data (e.g. no noise is added) and they are intuitive and relatively easy to explain to non-experts. Moreover, our implementation is highly versatile, as it supports binomial and multinomial target variables, different types of prediction models and a wide range of privacy protection techniques. All methods have been integrated into a sound framework that supports the creation, evaluation and refinement of models through intuitive graphical user interfaces. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our solution, we present three case studies in which we created and evaluated different types of privacy-preserving prediction models for breast cancer diagnosis, diagnosis of acute inflammation of the urinary system and prediction of the contraceptive method used by women. In this process, we also used a wide range of different privacy models (k-anonymity, differential privacy and a game-theoretic approach) as well as different data transformation techniques."

Such a system makes it possible to monitor the ongoing stream of messages on social media, offering actionable insights into public hesitance with respect to vaccination. At the moment, such monitoring is done by means of regular sentiment analysis with a poor performance on detecting negative stance towards vaccination. For Dutch Twitter messages that mention vaccination-related key terms, we annotated their stance and feeling in relation to vaccination (provided that they referred to this topic). Subsequently, we used these coded data to train and test different machine learning set-ups. With the aim to best identify messages with a negative stance towards vaccination, we compared set-ups at an increasing dataset size and decreasing reliability, at an increasing number of categories to distinguish, and with different classification algorithms."

This is the case in rural Liberia, where many health workers live and work in areas without any access to cellular connectivity or reliable power. Many existing EDC mobile software tools are built for occasionally-disconnected settings, allowing a user to collect data while out of range of a cell tower and transmit data to a central server when he/she regains a network connection. However, few tools exist that can be used indefinitely in fully-disconnected settings, where a user will never have access to the internet or a cell network. This led us to create and implement an EDC software tool that allows for completely offline data transfer and application updating."

The two standard deviation ranges for intra-individual short-term variation were approximately ±210 mL and ± 350 mL for FEV and IC respectively. In long-term, spirometry values increased and decreased without notable changes in symptoms as reported by CAT, although it was unusual with a decrease of more than 50 mL per measurement of FEV between three consecutive measurement days. No exacerbation occurred. There was a moderate to strong positive correlation between FEV and IC, but weak or absent correlation with the other prognostic markers in the majority of the participants."

The indicators for the clinical performance of a clinician are computed within a healthcare institution based on pseudonymized data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) system. Group-level indicators of clinicians across healthcare institutions are computed using privacy-preserving distributed data-mining techniques. A clinician receives feedback reports that compare his or her personal indicators with the aggregated indicators of the individual's peers. Indicators aggregated across different geographical levels are the basis for monitoring changes in the quality of care. The architecture feasibility was practically evaluated in three general practitioner (GP) offices in Norway that consist of about 20,245 patients. The architecture was applied for providing feedback reports to 21 GPs on their antibiotic prescriptions for selected respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Each GP received one feedback report that covered antibiotic prescriptions between 2015 and 2018, stratified yearly. We assessed the privacy protection and computation time of the architecture."

Patients and vascular surgeons in the intervention group receive decision support tools that may help them adopt shared decision-making when making the final treatment decision. These decision support tools are decision aids, consultation cards, decision cards, and a practical training. Decision aids are informative websites that help patients become more aware of the pros and cons of the treatment options and their preferences regarding the treatment choice. Consultation cards with text or decision cards with images are used by vascular surgeons during consultation to determine which aspect of a treatment is most important to their patient. In the training vascular surgeons can practice shared decision-making with a patient actor, guided by a medical psychologist.

We identified three different time horizons in CPOE use in relation to patients' treatments: life-long, the whole regimen, and the 'here and now'. CPOE supported ultra-safe strategies through automation and access to rules/standardisation, but also created difficulties and contributed to incidents. It supported the 'here and now' better than a life-long or whole regimen view of a patient treatment. Sensitivity to operations was essential to anticipate and resolve uncertainties, hazards, CPOE limitations, and mismatches between CPOE processes and workflow in practice."

Therefore, breast cancer treatment entity normalization becomes an essential task for the above downstream clinical studies. The latest studies have demonstrated the superiority of deep learning methods in named entity normalization tasks. Fundamentally, most existing approaches adopt pipeline implementations that treat it as an independent process after named entity recognition, which can propagate errors to later tasks.

When the number of available lumens is too low to facilitate the safe administration of these solutions, additional (peripheral) IV catheters are often required, causing physical discomfort and increasing the risk for catheter related complications. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an algorithm designed to reduce the number of intravenous lumens required in multi-infusion settings by multiplexing the administration of various parenteral drugs and solutions."

Stratified sampling technique was used to select 60 nurses working in critical care units of three hospitals affiliated with a large University of Medical Sciences in the southeast of Iran. These nurses were assigned randomly and equally to the control and intervention groups. NI competency was trained to the intervention group in a three-day workshop. Data were collected using demographic questionnaire and the adapted Nursing Informatics Competency Assessment Tool (NICAT) before and 1 month after the intervention. Rahman in the US (2015) developed and validated the original NICAT to assess self-reported NI competency of nurses with 30 items and three dimensions (Computer literacy, Informatics literacy Information management skills). The NICAT is scored on a five-point Likert scale and the overall score ranges from 30 to150. Two medical informatics specialists and eight nursing faculty members approved the validity of the adapted version of NICAT and its reliability was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha (95%)."

In the pretest stage, both intervention and control groups were competent in terms of the NI competency and its dimensions, and no significant difference was observed between them (p = 0.65). However, in the posttest, the NI competency and its dimensions in the intervention group significantly increased with a large effect size compared with the control group (p = 0.001).
